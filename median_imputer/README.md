# median_imputer
This script should not be run. It merely implements a baseline imputer that uses the median as the value to impute. It can impute using the row median, column median, or the median of all of the data.

This code is primarily used in the `test_imputer_rmse` script, but the results of the median imputer are not reported in the paper.
