Text: Few realize Puccini originally wrote the song as Del Monaco sings with the brief 'vin-cer-o' at the end, I also prefer Pavarotti's rendition holding the 'vin-ceeeeer-o' a bit longer. I prefer Monaco's deeper tone over Pavarotti's brighter voice but yes considering IMO they're the two best ever on this piece, we shouldn't critique!
