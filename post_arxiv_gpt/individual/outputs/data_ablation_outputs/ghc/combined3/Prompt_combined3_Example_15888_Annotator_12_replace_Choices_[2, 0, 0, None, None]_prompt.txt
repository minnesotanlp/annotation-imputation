Example 1:
Text: I grew up riding. We had a beautiful and gentle quarter horse. I trained her to let me fire a rifle from the saddle. Growing up like a cowboy was so much fun. When I was only 12 I'd go out riding with my Ruger 10/22 and it was no big deal, nobody raised an eyebrow to see a boy on a horse with his gun, and this was in California!

Text: So much emotion that I came close to tearing. Yet I see the trends on Twitter and women are bitching about Kavanaugh crying. I'd be crying and raging if I got accused of something. Women are such heartless people in 2018.
