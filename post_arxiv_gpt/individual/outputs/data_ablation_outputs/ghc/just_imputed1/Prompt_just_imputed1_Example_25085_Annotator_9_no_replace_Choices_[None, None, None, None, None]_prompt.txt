Example 2:
Text: In 1913, the U.S. government not only legalized slavery via the income tax, directly and forcibly confiscating the fruits of people‚Äôs labor, but also, by way of the Federal Reserve Act, legalized a level of counterfeiting and bank fraud which boggles the mind. In short, the politicians gave bankers legal permission to make up money out of thin air, and to loan such fake, fabricated money out, at interest, to others, including governments. Though most people are unaware of the specifics of how such huge frauds and robberies occur via fiat currencies and fractional reserve banking, many people now have a gut instinct that the banks are doing something deceptive and corrupt. What they fail to realize is that it was the government which gave the banks permission to defraud and swindle the public out of literally trillions of dollars.

Text: There are a lot of examples of politicizing sports, both much more old and much more recent. The latest I'm aware of is all this drama about how American football players should or shouldn't behave when the national anthem is playing. Point is, sports is politics, and it's not possible to separate one from another.
