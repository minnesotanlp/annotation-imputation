Text: I agree, they have nothing, but that's what I call Flake a coward as he's playing on the Democrat's team. They just want to delay to affect the mid-terms. Lindsay Graham of all people took a stand to defend an innocent man. Flake's game is to help the Democrats get more time to ruin Brett K's reputation further because he thinks he's standing on principle. That's a joke if I ever heard one.

Text: There are a lot of examples of politicizing sports, both much more old and much more recent. The latest I'm aware of is all this drama about how American football players should or shouldn't behave when the national anthem is playing. Point is, sports is politics, and it's not possible to separate one from another.
