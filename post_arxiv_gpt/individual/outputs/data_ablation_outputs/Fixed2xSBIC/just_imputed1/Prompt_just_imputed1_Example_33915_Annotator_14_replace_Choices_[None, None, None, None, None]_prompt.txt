Example 4:
Text: K&R only did it because pre-ANSI C was weird. some_function(x, y) double x; char y; { code_goes_here(); } Putting braces on the same line would've looked awful. When ANSI came out, it got simplified to this: int some_function(double x, char y) { code_goes_here(); } K&R never updated their coding standards because they wanted something compatible with both pre-ANSI and ANSI C, but they *could* have just thrown pre-ANSI C under the bus if they wanted to.
