Text: My Coworker:: I'm about to buy her a one-way ticket back to Africa My Supervisor:: HA! I'll pitch in. They were talking about me via IM. Both men were white. Found this in the IM log in 2010.  When I submitted this finding to corporate, they were both fired, but the prevailing message is that even after 500 yrs in America, we still don't belong. I was 33, May 2010, Atlanta, GA, at work. Made me feel like even though I am a descendant of slaves, I still don't belong in America.
