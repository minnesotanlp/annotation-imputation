In this dataset, annotators are asked whether text is offensive. There are three possible labels: not offensive (0), maybe (1), offensive (2)

Target Example:
Text: "RT @NotKamara: I would be mad if a ""friend"" put my business on the internet. Bitch I don't even put my business on the internet."
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer corresponding to the label.
