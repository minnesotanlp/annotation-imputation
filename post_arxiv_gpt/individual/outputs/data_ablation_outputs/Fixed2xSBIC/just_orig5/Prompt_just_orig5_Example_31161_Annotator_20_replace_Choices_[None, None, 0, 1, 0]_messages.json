Your output should be an integer label:\nTarget Example:\nText: \"RT @NotKamara: I would be mad if a \"\"friend\"\" put my business on the internet. Bitch I don't even put my business on the internet.\"\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer corresponding to the label."
