In this dataset, annotators are asked whether text is offensive. There are three possible labels: not offensive (0), maybe (1), offensive (2)

Target Example:
Text: MR POTTER OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS, HE IS AN AWFUL FUCKING COUNSELOR
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer corresponding to the label.
