In this dataset, annotators are asked whether text is offensive. There are three possible labels: not offensive (0), maybe (1), offensive (2)

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: So, will the French terrorists be heading to Turkey where Erdogan can protect them and send them safely to ISIS? #Islam
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer corresponding to the label.
