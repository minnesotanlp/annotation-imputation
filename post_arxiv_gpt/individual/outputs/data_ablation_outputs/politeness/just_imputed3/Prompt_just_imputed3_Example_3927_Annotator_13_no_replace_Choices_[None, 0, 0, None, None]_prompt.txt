Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 2:
Text: Hi the table you removed was added after a discussion <url>, so please give us a reason why you removed it??
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 3:

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 4:
Text: I don't recall any consensus on that unilateral change. Can you direct me to it, please?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 6:
Text: Wait, Rob got blocked again? Why?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 7:
Text: As I've only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut-and-paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly.  Was db-1 the right tag for <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 8:
Text: It would be better to have this discussion on the TKD talk page. Why don't you re-post it there?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 9:
Text: You lost me J. I did the edits because I remember you telling me that repeating things that are already in the wiki-link is unneeded and/or redundant. Do you not recall that instance?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 10:
Text: You have given your point by point rebuttals to my reasons several times. How can you say I haven't provided my reasoning?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 11:
Text: Owing to your status as an active wikipedian, I'm not yet reverting your edit to this article.  But what sense is it to move his birth location from the birthdate position in line one, to the top of (a newly formed) paragraph 2 which then (continues from the former paragraph 1 subject) takes off on a subject entirely unrelated to his birth?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 12:
Text: Although Singapore does not use Traditional Chinese, I still think we should at least add Traditional Chinese titles for shows not made by Mediacorp, and bought from overseas (mainly Hong Kong) TV stations. What do you think?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 13:
Text: Hi, You stated the editor is inactive, yet the editor is stalking me through MY CONTRIBUTIONS and reverting my entries and the editor left a message on the top of my TALK page, so why would you not block them ?  You didn't even give them a warning ?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 14:
Text: It appears that that article was deleted because not enough info was found on the person. Doesn't the new article have enough info?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 15:
Text: Some pictures are not mine, but those that I have changed, their own. And you can submit a complaint the owners of those photos?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 8

Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 20:
Text: Howcheng, <url>u2014Great pic, but needs size, and the readers are caught between small at 550px or huge at full res. I wonder whether 600px would be possible, with a link to the interactive wideview function at the end of the blurb?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 21:
Text: <url>  Honestly, I'd like to know if you really are defending <url>.  Do you really believe that they were justified?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 22:
Text: So, let me make sure I understand this. You think that, if we remove an image as it does not meet the NFCC, you would then be able to upload the same image, only this time, it would meet the NFCC?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 23:
Text: ---- Though I thought I would note that you have now exceeded <big>'''500'''</big> edits while on "wikibreak" and that is over less than 10 days, May I ask what kind of break is that???
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 24:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 29:

Annotation from annotator: 14
