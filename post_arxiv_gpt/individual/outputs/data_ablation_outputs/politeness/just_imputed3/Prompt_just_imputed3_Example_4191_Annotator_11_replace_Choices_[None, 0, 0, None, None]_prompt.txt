Estimated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: Hi, do you mind if I move your hook to go live on 26/27th? The GLAM WIKI conference could do with being highlighed by a non US/UK hook?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 2:
Text: Thanks terribly for looking it up. Would it be alright for me to use the new source in Europe, economy section then?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 3:
Text: Hey, I just tried to link to Marat Ayin and it came up as a red link. Do you know if we have an article on it and I'm just not using the right transliteration or do we really not have an article?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 4:
Text: Are you really denying that you brought Giano and Bishonen's names into this? Seriously?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: The admin says he thinks it should be renamed, but someone else is trying to pull the "but it happened in the same area nonsense". Was I clear enough in explaining where the pictures are listed?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 6:
Text: You lost me J. I did the edits because I remember you telling me that repeating things that are already in the wiki-link is unneeded and/or redundant. Do you not recall that instance?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 7:
Text: Help how? Do you mean disambiguating links like this:<url>?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 8:
Text: But the main question was that would it be a bad idea to make more articles about characters, orginizations and etc. in a book?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 9:
Text: I'm with you - it really is a friggin' pain that people refuse to read no matter how big you put the text.  Should we just maybe remove the source entirely?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 10:
Text: I apologize if I have misunderstood.  Are you not an acknowledged devotee of Prem Rawat?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 11:
Text: WHADDAFUCK YA GONNA DO TO ME, HUH BITCH!?????????
Annotation from annotator: 0

Example 12:
Text: AnonEMouse, I have noticed today that there are many recent comments on the <url> talk page that do not show in "history". How can that happen?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 13:
Text: Especially considering that it took you ''a lot'' more time to vandalize the page than the two seconds it took us to fix it. What's the point?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 14:
Text: I'm glad you made things calculate automatically (and I trust you've tested it!). Shouldn't we update the <url> to not show the unneeded variables, then?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 15:
Text: I looked at all the provinces and regencies listed on <url> - so that trick is mostly played out. I'm going down the alphabet now and I'm at the R's - if you want to work, maybe you could start at the end of the alphabet so we don't interfere with each other, meet in the middle?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 16:
Text: I don't see the references anywhere. Do you mean the "glimcher website" and "official website" links?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:
Text: It is disputed among admins regarding the protection of userpages, although the policy says that users can have their user/user sub-pages (but not the talks) semi-protected if the user requests it. Are there other subpages of yours that you'd like protecting?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 18:
Text: It just doesn't make sense (to me) that we use a manga spelling for one name but a Simmons' spelling for another. Can't we just go along with Simmons on this one?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 19:
Text: Well, lyrics are generally frowned upon on Wikipedia, unless the song is old enough that its copyright no longer applies. Could you perhaps link to the article?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 20:
Text: Halfling may be another name for Hobbit, but the model for the Hobbit encouraged the creation of other Halflings. Nevertheless it is a Halfling, is it not?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 21:
Text: Your bot runs awfully fast. How come there isn't "using AWB" in the edit summary?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 22:
Text: I couldn't find your "email user" function. What's up?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 23:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 24:
Text: APS = <url>. You lost me, which plant are you referring to above?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 25:
Text: In the summer (June-July) I am going to work on the ''Messiah'' article. Would you like to be in on this?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 26:
Text: I have just reported a high level of Vandalism at the page <url>. Is it possible to impose a temporary protection to the page?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 27:
Text: What is your objection?  Would a split address your concerns?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 28:
Text: That's a <url>-length rant. Still, be nice and AGF, okay?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 30:
Text: I believe it was I who moved it, based on what appeared to be consensus to use the hyphen in that context.  Where is this guideline of which you speak that suggests otherwise?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Target Example:
Text: Good day, sorry to bother you. Is the 2:00 am news brief called eyewitness news everynite, and if it is do they play move closer to your world?
