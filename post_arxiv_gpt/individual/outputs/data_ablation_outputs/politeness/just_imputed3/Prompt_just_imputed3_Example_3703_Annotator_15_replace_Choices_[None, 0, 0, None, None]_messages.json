I seem to remember there was some issue years ago with a rock group of the same name, but don't you look at these things before you delete?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 2:\nText: I seem to have adopted this article, since country music and dance are interests of mine. Can you recommend an easy to use bot that would help me in keeping those unwanted links out of the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 3:\nText: I put plural women because in the storylines it states he falls for Detective Graves. He also hits on another older woman <url> but that wasn't notable enough to include.. is it best to keep it singular?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 4:\nText: This is a really sore subject, because most of parents of kids with learning difficulties dont agree with the term \"retardation\" - it is unscientific and also quite abusive. Could you please delete the category or rename it \"learning disability organisations ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi again. How do you become an administrator?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: <url> and <url> are both accounts which have vandalised the article, and both have been created solely for vandalism. I believe they're one and the same; do you know an admin that can take action?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: I can't remember if I asked/checked to see if it got to you? So... did it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: Is the caption \"Steelhead trout has been said to exist in Aliso Creek...\" grammatically correct?  Should it be \"have been\", referring to the trout as a group?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 9:\nText: pls see my comments on your revert on the talk page.  Perhaps you'll consider undoing my revert?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 10:\nText: I'm surprised no one has seen my sneaky joke category addition. Can I put <url> in there as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: You're a math teacher, right?  May I ask what grade level?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 12:\nText: In <url>, people seemed to agree with you, but I just don't understand your proposal. So, what exactly do you mean in terms of category renaming/merging/recategorization?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: <url>. What do you think should be done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: It's probably not notable, but it was already <url> once. Perhaps a selective merge to <url> might be an idea?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 15:\nText: I don't get it, Tintor2. Why do you think Sephiroth is not <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: I see you deleted this page a while back as an attack page.  Any chance that the information originally had anything to do with the John Lamb mentioned in <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 17:\nText: Everything about <url> looks fantastic, but.. going to |2 instead of |30em seems like a major step back. Is there a reason for it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Hi, you removed links from \"Microscope image processing\" which I just added to resources which contain information on digital microsocopy. How to define their (ir-)relevance and justify their validity (or not) for inclusion/exclusion on this page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 19:\nText: Why tag for deletion? It was obviously a new user's attempt at creating a disambiguation page, why not clean it up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 20:\nText: Hey, can you block this moron from editing the IIHF Page? Or what can i do in such cases?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 21:\nText: I reverted <url> as it complicated my normal routine archiving of all the discussions on my talk page.  Could you please refrain from this kind of edit in future?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: The layout is there and also some content but due to lack of time during the recent past I was unable to bring it to the final 'publication suitable' form. Perhaps you could help me in giving the final touches?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 23:\nText: Hi, Wereon - I'm afraid I'm rather amateur at nominating articles for deletion. Where do I start?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 24:\nText: Hi, I wanted to ask what do you follow to create redirects on this <url>??\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 25:\nText: I think the <url> would be more precise and accurate as <url>. What sayest thou?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 26:\nText: Martin, sorry to disturb you, but you said that Kelson is making the new ZIM file, where is the location of that file? Does it also reside at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 27:\nText: Thank you much! May I call upon you if I make mistakes or need help, then, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 28:\nText: Sure. A redirect how though?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: There is a QB at camp today wearing #1. I saw him in footage on NFL Network. Who is he?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 30:\nText: Regarding our WikiProject discussion about airport naming, I am unsure about Wiki etiquette - should I edit your sandbox with links indicating the common name (i.e. airport even though it's an aerodrome) or should I list them on my own talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nTarget Example:\nText: In this <url> there was a loss of some info.  Was that intentional?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
