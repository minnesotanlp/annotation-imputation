Estimated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: Errr, okay.  But let's make sure our answers are accurate by using <url> rather than something we heard someone say, eh?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 2:
Text: I'm not sure if you've changed your opinion of the article's FAC status, but I think you have guided us in a ton of good ideas.  Have you changed your opinion?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 3:
Text: Well, yes, obviously (but I sort of assumed that the same exemptions would apply to 1RR as 3RR - is that not the case?) Should I self-rv?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 4:
Text: Steineresque! Shall I have a go, or will you?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 5:
Text: Actually, if she is releasing a new single from the debut album, the title "Home Run" wouldn't encompass this. Someone else has changed it to "Debut album" which I think is more suiting, what do you think?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 6:
Text: I think it's a great idea to get the CO3 community involved with keeping <url> correct and uptodate.  I shan't be there myself this year (clashes with various things) - would you be able to bring it up?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 7:
Text: Unfortunately I think <url> may also add that material; I am not familiar with Citizendum, though, but I will look at it. If Citizendum has the same policies regarding primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, then why not criticize both Wikipedia and Citizendum?

Example 8:
Text: Do you sign your name using 4 tildes? (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>)?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 9:
Text: You know, occasionally, Momoricks will send me a note telling how one of my snarkier edit summaries made her laugh. Is that the case for the triple-misspell revert I did?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 10:
Text: Emico, you have to understand that sometimes people use different words to describe the same thing. If I find a source saying "Hitler killed himself" and I write "Hitler committed suicide" am I wrong because the word ''suicide'' isn't in the sources?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 11:
Text: Are you sure that you want to withdraw your nomination to delete the 2 old articles? Don't you want the 2 articles deleted since they have been merged into something much better?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 12:
Text: I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the "sh" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 13:
Text: I agree with you in that this chapter has no place on <url>, moreover its inclusion there seems highly suspicious. Is there any way to see who added a particular word/sentence/paragraph without manually going through the history?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 14:
Text: I find it done both ways on the web.  If some convention requires capitalizing it even though it's not anything like a proper noun, I think that should get explained in the article, otherwise reasonable people will wonder who it's named after: someone named Saros, but what's his first name and where's the Wikipedia article about him?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 15:
Text: Denied. I take it then that you deny responsiblity for an account (which I'll not name here) created just four minutes after you made that edit?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 16:
Text: I have put another warning on <url> with full details of the vandalism. Can this be reported to London Grid, please?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 17:
Text: These edits appear to be related to the same issue that caused the page to be protected. Could you please explain why you are doing this?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 18:
Text: I've heard about the controversy. What's your take on it?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 19:
Text: I remember your commenting on this about seven years ago.  What's your view today?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 20:
Text: I was just about to point that out. Is that permitted?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 21:
Text: Are you both "Dribblingscribe" and "Indiestu" ? Do both those accounts belong to the same person?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 22:
Text: Could possibly be. Have you tagged any of the non-free images for review?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 23:
Text: This is my first time at review-sorry if I blew it.  The article passes just fine--what do I do at DYK to indicate that?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 24:
Text: Thanks for the redactions :). Is it worth getting a third opinion at the reliable sources noticeboard vis a vis the use of law textbooks for points of law?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 25:
Text: How does it feel being wikifamous??
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 26:
Text: I'm gonna go ahead and do it. Thoughts before I proceed?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 27:
Text: Thanks.  Is Brazil4Linux doing anything particully bad right now?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 28:

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 29:
Text: You are obviously very busy. How should I proceed?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 30:
Text: Why am I never asked to write a feature. Is it because "I is black"?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Target Example:
Text: Im sorry to see that you withdrew. Maybe next time?
