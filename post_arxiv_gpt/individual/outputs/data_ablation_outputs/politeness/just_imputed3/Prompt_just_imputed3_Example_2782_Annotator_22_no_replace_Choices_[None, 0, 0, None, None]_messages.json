Do you feel that you've done what you said you were going to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 2:\nText: Thank you for your input in my article on Iowa State Track and Field! I am trying to improve the article more and wondered if you could look at it and make suggestions that may improve the current content?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 3:\nText: And, by the way, shouldn't there have to be actual copyright VIOLATIONS (not just a lack of a machine-readable tag) to delete a photograph? Or are we so concerned with making our project bot-friendly that it doesn't matter if we lose really great images in the process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 4:\nText: An article about a craver named <url> needs some work. Can you clean the article up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hello, Jeff79. Would you weigh in on the above linked discussion regarding an edit you made?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: I wouldn't know where to put it. I know Record Charts is for charts etc and the certifications but where would I put a discography question?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 7:\nText: <url>.  Draft beer?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: One more thing if you want, let's talk on the Seinfeld talk page. I think I am taking up your talk page so let's talk there instead, ok?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks. Any idea how I log into this account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 10:\nText: If the llamas of Peru spoke Spanish, and one asked the other, ''xbfCxf3mo se llama?'', would he get confused?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Thanks for the various corrections you have made to this article. Do you have a source for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date of 921, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 12:\nText: Just curious... Where did it come from?  Where did you cut and paste it from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: I was thinking about bringing that up.  I wonder if this is the first time someone's beat me to it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hi, I meant to do this a long time ago, but I guess I forgot.  You are the \"Sandpiper\" on the HP wiki right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 15:\nText: Haha, hey guys. Who is Temple alumni?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 16:\nText: It would be even funnier if you did attend the rally but weren't the giant tea bag guy I added to your user page.

Why bother removing spaces from the redirects if it doesn't change the functionality at all?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 22:\nText: Hello, again. Would you care to intervene at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 23:\nText: Tim, it strikes me that DNA is getting more than average vandalism for daytime; I suspect it's schoolbreak week somewhere.  I'm not able to help much as it takes so long for the page to load; do you think it's time to ask for a semi-protection break?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 24:\nText: Just one more thing: The <url>' logo was re-made as a vector image a little while ago, but the colors (especially the skin), really seem to be off. Can you fix it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 25:\nText: In your most recent edit to <url> you stated that the track in Clermont, Florida does not fulfill IAAF regulations (since reverted by another editor).

Whats you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 28:\nText: In an article like <url>, I think it would be better if you based the content on secondary sources rather than articles that you have found in the ''BMJ'''s online archive. Could I persuade you to discuss your additions on <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 29:\nText: An excellent news, indeed! I don't have time to have a look at it right now (busy with the fr FA), but do they have something on Gndevank?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 30:\nText: From looking at the talk page archive, I see you you were a voice of moderation at <url> some time ago.
