How do you convert your commutative diagrams from LaTeX to PNG?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 2:\nText: When you deleted <url> did you accidentally overlook the <person> template?

Hector again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: I wonder if it would ever be worth doing an article on G&S scholarship?

If so, would you add the relevant flag?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: There's a nice section on funerals <url> but I'm not given a look at the contributors' page (p. 673) to see who J.B. is.

And what do you mean by \"the referencing is insuficcient\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 19:\nText: Thank you for removing the \"Speedy Deletion\" from my post. I realise that I still need to do more work on the post itself, but are the sources that I am using acceptable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 20:\nText: <url> wasn't me.

Any comments?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 25:\nText: <url> posted a wonderful grammatical analysis of the \"has/had\" thing, another editor agreed, so I'm thinking we should make another request for the change, using Bluewave's post as the basis.

How can I make the different chapters of my main source book show up correctly?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 28:\nText: I did notice that some articles linked to the ones I worked on are now missing, which leaves a link hanging.
