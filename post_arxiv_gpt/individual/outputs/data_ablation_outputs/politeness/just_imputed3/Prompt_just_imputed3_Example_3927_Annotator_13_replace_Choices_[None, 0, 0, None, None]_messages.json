Can you make a comment in this discussion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: Also, I was looking at the edit history for <url>, as I thought I had created the page (honestly I cannot remember), but the history prior to your move of the list to <url> is missing.  Do you know what happened to it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: Yes, I posted a link to the history. I was asking/thinking where you stepped into the discussion and if you were editing as an IP and that would put a different slant on your 3rr warning to Bbb23?, have you been recently editing the article was the simple question?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi, just noticed you reverted this page back to its pre-COPYVIO state.  Any reason you didn't use the content at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: I find it hard to believe one editor (even one so prolific as RickK) can have much of an effect overall. Do contributors on either side have any (non-anecdotal) evidence that suggests otherwise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 6:\nText: I'm highly in favor of \"exposing Wikipedia's users\" to these excellent pictures; that should go for ''all'' of Wikipedia's users, not just the ones who use this English edition.  What do you think: could we add a note to <url> encouraging people to put their FPCs on the Commons?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Nice continued work on the expressway articles.  Is it possible to have some maps or schematic diagrams showing the location or routes of the expressways?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hey, I see you've been contributing! Time to lose the \"leaving Wikipedia\" box?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 9:\nText: You realize the bot maintains a separate page, right? Is it not possible that the \"problem\" is having the pages inconsistent?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 10:\nText: Don't worry I understand. Using igloo I assume?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 11:\nText: If you're not going to reply then I will undo the edit. Again, why have \"Fictional martial artists\" over the sub-cat \"Anime and manga martial artists\" and not use alphabetical order?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hi there again, just reminding you that the review must be archived over at WP:Biography as well, not only marked as such in the article Talk page. Do you think Markus's last concern was addressed to his satisfaction?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 13:\nText: Ideally, we add it to <url>, because that article is terribly bad, and this is a good starting point for a ''major'' part of it.  I assume the sources are not OR?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: What do you mean by \"one edit war away\"? And whats a siteban?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 15:\nText: You created <url>, there is already a page that similar <url>. Why don't you mix 2 articles together?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 16:\nText: Agree, it would need RFC. One question - should we set up 2 RFCs, as the RFC draft itself suggests - one for the general principle, and the other (separate) for specific REVDEL critieria which the community may or may not endorse, discuss, or make suggestions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 17:\nText: No, Wikipedia does not consider itself (or wikis in general) as a reliable source. Surely you know such a basic policy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 18:\nText: I tend not to be an RFC closer -- apologies. Hopefully someone else will?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 19:\nText: Hi - how's it going?  Do you need more time?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 20:\nText: I understand, it could be quite time consuming. Maybe we could do a collab for an article related to Thalia (once I'm finished with some work)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 21:\nText: Could you clarify this? You're claiming that Betacommand knew before drama exploded onwiki that you were Pickbothmanlol, but did not share that with the community?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 22:\nText: You might want to look at <url> then. Should I do to <url>, <url>, <url> (and others) like you did to Jake Ryan (eg, removing words like \"a\" and \"the\" in the beginning of sentences)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 23:\nText: Still at 1024 x 768 here '''Zangar''' and still looks fine to me. What about putting one of the images into the infobox using the piped 'static image=' parameter?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: I tried to create a similar map for Canada but couldn't get a usable output from the site you used for the Australia map. Could you create a Canadian one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sorry about that. I guess instructions are there for a reason, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 26:\nText: I want to purchase a macro lens and was hoping for some guidance from you. Apart from being good in macro, can it be used to take good pictures of landscape and portraits?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: That should be good now. Except isn't it el-Senussi not El Senussi?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 28:\nText: They're back again - this time with IP 37.105.37.15 (also from Saudi Telecom Co DSL). Fortunately Jasper Deng stepped in - I presume they're an admin of some sort?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: Is the new draft at <url> OK with you? Do you have any comments or suggestions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 30:\nText: I also have problems with a lot of the other recategorisation you have done to these articles, but I won't revert any more until I hear from you.  Taking <url> as an example: why have you removed it from <url> when it clearly is a linear filter; why remove it from <url> when it forms part of image parameter theory; why does an article which discusses electronic designs not belong in <url>; why remove it from <url> when, obviously, it is a term?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Interesting.  Would you mind asking at which Sae Gae seminar on what date it was taken?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
