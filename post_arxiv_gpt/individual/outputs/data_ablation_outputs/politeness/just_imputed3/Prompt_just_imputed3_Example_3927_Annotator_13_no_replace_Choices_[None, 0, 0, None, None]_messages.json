Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 2:\nText: Hi the table you removed was added after a discussion <url>, so please give us a reason why you removed it??\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: Yeah, chances are it is. How long do you reckon it will be before he edits a Sydney related article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 4:\nText: I don't recall any consensus on that unilateral change. Can you direct me to it, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 5:\nText: OK, maybe I only started noticing it after that incident. Do you have diffs for your earlier opinions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 6:\nText: Wait, Rob got blocked again? Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 7:\nText: As I've only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut-and-paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly.  Was db-1 the right tag for <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 8:\nText: It would be better to have this discussion on the TKD talk page. Why don't you re-post it there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: You lost me J. I did the edits because I remember you telling me that repeating things that are already in the wiki-link is unneeded and/or redundant. Do you not recall that instance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 10:\nText: You have given your point by point rebuttals to my reasons several times. How can you say I haven't provided my reasoning?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 11:\nText: Owing to your status as an active wikipedian, I'm not yet reverting your edit to this article.  But what sense is it to move his birth location from the birthdate position in line one, to the top of (a newly formed) paragraph 2 which then (continues from the former paragraph 1 subject) takes off on a subject entirely unrelated to his birth?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 12:\nText: Although Singapore does not use Traditional Chinese, I still think we should at least add Traditional Chinese titles for shows not made by Mediacorp, and bought from overseas (mainly Hong Kong) TV stations. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: Hi, You stated the editor is inactive, yet the editor is stalking me through MY CONTRIBUTIONS and reverting my entries and the editor left a message on the top of my TALK page, so why would you not block them ?  You didn't even give them a warning ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 14:\nText: It appears that that article was deleted because not enough info was found on the person. Doesn't the new article have enough info?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: Some pictures are not mine, but those that I have changed, their own. And you can submit a complaint the owners of those photos?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 16:\nText: Gee, thanks. But shouldn't it be a barnstar for '''''bad''''' humor, or maybe for the humor \"phlegm\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 17:\nText: I'll have a look (probably just for copyediting duties) once Zag has finished the larger changes. Keep me posted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: You told me that you couldn't access the page in question, although I had recently changed the link to its new location. Maybe you just didn't bother to check it out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 19:\nText: I am happy to rewrite it but please explain to me how it is any different from the Warrior Lacrosse and STX pages? They don't have any links except to their own websites?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 20:\nText: Howcheng, <url>u2014Great pic, but needs size, and the readers are caught between small at 550px or huge at full res. I wonder whether 600px would be possible, with a link to the interactive wideview function at the end of the blurb?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: <url>  Honestly, I'd like to know if you really are defending <url>.  Do you really believe that they were justified?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 22:\nText: So, let me make sure I understand this. You think that, if we remove an image as it does not meet the NFCC, you would then be able to upload the same image, only this time, it would meet the NFCC?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 23:\nText: ---- Though I thought I would note that you have now exceeded <big>'''500'''</big> edits while on \"wikibreak\" and that is over less than 10 days, May I ask what kind of break is that???\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 24:\nText: Fair enough on the general murder victims. But Kriss Donald was British, was he not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 25:\nText: One to go. Shouldn't \"now welcome\" be \"not welcome\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 26:\nText: Evidently, I don't have enough consciousness, because I haven't the foggiest idea of what you're talking about. Could you tell me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 27:\nText: I noticed that you have a lot of empty or blanked sandboxes that you used before moving articles to mainspace. Do you want these deleted or are you saving them for something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: u2013 Use that dash my friend. How are you geting on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 29:\nText: I noticed that (although it's striked through now), you considered opposing <url>'s adminship bid on the grounds that they suffer from auditory hallucinations. For future consideration, may I point you <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 30:\nText: I tried updating it to WP:DAB style but I got reverted. Can you use your magic there and explain to the user why we should follow MOS:DP and such?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Interesting.  Would you mind asking at which Sae Gae seminar on what date it was taken?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
