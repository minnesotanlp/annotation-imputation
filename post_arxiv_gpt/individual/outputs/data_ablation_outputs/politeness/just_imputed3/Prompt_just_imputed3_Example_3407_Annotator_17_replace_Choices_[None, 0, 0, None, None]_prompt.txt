Example 7:
Text: Concerning <url>, I must say I am a bit confused: isn't the article's title "Austria<span style="color:red">u2013</span>Hungary" (where, incidentally, it was moved after an "Austria<span style="color:red">-</span>Hungary" period)? It's really no big deal, but how can something be both correct and incorrect, and which standard are we at long last supposed to follow?

Example 8:
Text: I have addressed many of the points that you had brought up at the FAC, as well as many of the comments from other editors, some of whom have changed their sentiment recently to "Support".  Perhaps you could reevaluate your stance on the article, and see if you feel you could change your position in the current FAC?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 26:
Text: ''You wrote:'' I'm not trying to be obtuse, but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7?
