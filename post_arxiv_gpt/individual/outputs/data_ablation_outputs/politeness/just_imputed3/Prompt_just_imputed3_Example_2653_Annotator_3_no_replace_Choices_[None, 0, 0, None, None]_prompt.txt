Estimated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: It's archived onto CD; I'll have to search it out. Suggestion on what you'd like to see in the way of resolution?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 2:
Text: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 3:
Text: Sorry to bother you but theres a report on <url> regarding <url> which has been a target for IP vandalism. I'm only asking directly  because the vandalism is continuing and I'm close to not being able to fight it anymore under policy so can I ask if you could please issue the protection and revert the IP's vandalism back to my last revision?

Annotation from annotator: 14

Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 7:

Text: <url>???
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 9:
Text: One other question I have is that the ''Wikipedia'' article states that his 1968 paper had been first rejected by American publications before it was accepted by the British one. Would you happen to know why?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 10:
Text: <url> It would be better if the content was not quite so pejorative. Perhaps a rewording?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Text: I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding your question. Could you try again?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 15:

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 17:
Text: It looks like the category functioning works.  Can we get an alert to render instead of the default missing parameter <nowiki>{{{1}}}}</nowiki> behaviour?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 18:
Text: It's a possibility, but still leaves the problem that the terms are US Army jargon (at least, I don't recall hearing them anywhere else!). Maybe a transwiki to Wiktionary would be better?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 19:
Text: I note also that so far you seem to be the sole editor who favors deletion, while several have favored retention of the article, possibly with editing. Could it be that your view does not command consensus?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 20:
Text: I was about to ask the same question on <url>.  Did you ever find out?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 9

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 29:

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 30:

Annotation from annotator: 17

Target Example:
Text: I've removed my remark. But if somebody puts words in another's mouth, and that second person states that is not what he meant, and the first person responds that no, that ''is'' what the second person meant, well, wouldn't you say that's a little weird?
