Estimated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: You do realise this is complete rubbish - it's already been speedily deleted once if you check the logs. I can't see any advantage to having this crap floating around for 5 days - can you?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 2:
Text: Certainly the work is out of copyright, and some of the neighboring volumes in the series are visible on archive.org (and I don't have trouble with other books on google generally).  I wonder if you know of any way, or could suggest any way, that I could get to see the downloaded pdf of Newcomb vol.6?

Example 3:
Text: I went to WP:VAND and looked up sneaky vandalism. To qualify for the reward, does it only have to qualify as sneaky or does it have to be "extra" sneaky?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 4:
Text: I think the story is worth recording, and I could add several more references.  I have to ask... are you related to Boyds, Smileys, or Souters?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 5:
Text: Since your tube station articles don't actually contain any information, what is the point of them? Why not put them together and work them into an article that says something interesting?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 6:
Text: The Hitchin-related hoax claims by <url> seem to have led to a rather precipitate response, considering that he has only been an editor for a few days.  Is there something going on here that isn't obvious?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 7:
Text: clear about when the inverse exists.  Is there a formal theorem that would apply?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 8:
Text: This is irritating. What browser are you using?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 9:
Text: Why did you revert my edits on that page? You say it was unsourced but it was sourced, I put two references to two fair sources (not blogs nor politicaly bound), so why did you remove them?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 10:
Text: Good work on the canal junctions! Where appropriate, do you think we should give the nearest pedestrian access point, from the road (as opposed to canal) network?
Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 11:
Text: Should I move it myself, or would you like me to walk you thru it? Have you read <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 12:
Text: I noticed you've put in quite a few posts in the gun politics talk pages. I'm just wondering do you have an interest in firearms or just the politics behind them and their use?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 13:
Text: Was this wholesale revert really necessary? <url>  Did the edit completely fail to improve the article in any way?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 14:
Text: Hi Steve, I've added refs & cites to this article. Do you think it still needs a warning about lack of refs/citations?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 15:
Text: Can I ask why you deleted this AfD as "A3: Article has no meaningful, substantive content"?  It obviously did have meaningful content; was there any reason it couldn't simply be closed like any other AfD?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 16:
Text: See <url>. I assume you didn't mean <url> ?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 18:
Text: Thank you. Do you have any tips on the Kathy Dunderdale article to improve it?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 19:
Text: I don't think removing that info is the correct fix. Just change the punctuation... OK if I do so?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 20:
Text: Hi Zaps, thanks for adding a source to the timetable as a reference for the destinations served. But how do you know that Sharjah and Istanbul are operated as charter flights?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 21:
Text: I very much disagree that the article that was deleted was advertising; I have never bought anything from his store as a matter of fact, but I do know that his is one of the most used online Judaica shops out there. What can I do to make the article acceptable?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 22:
Text: One question - how come the page is marked as "in dispute"?  The data that is currently posted isn't in dispute, correct?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 23:
Text: <url> is a validly notable topic which has been ruthlessly  suppressed at WP, probably because of egoism rather than religionist POV warriors but possibly both. Can you advise me on how to go about appealling deletions?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 24:
Text: I was thinking about creating a page about Nintendo eShop. And since you are a well trusted user I am asking you if you think that would just be deleted because there isn't enough information?
Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 25:
Text: I pretty much agree with <url>, except I would like to know why you modified the see also section to be a hatnote. Doesn't <url> have specific requirements for this?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 26:
Text: Thanks for pointing out that "undiscussed moves" discussion, I hope something comes out of that - but it doesn't really look like it will.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for on the discussion page for <url> about this, what am I missing?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 27:
Text: I must be missing something here.  Would you mind clarifying for me the nature of your extensive work on <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 28:
Text: I think I updated the pharmacology project banner to put C-class articles into the appropriate category (previously, it was putting them into the unassessed class. If you want to double-check, that would be great; I think it may take a little while for it to update the articles?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 29:
Text: I moved '''Engine Arm Aqueduct''' to <url>, because there seemed to be much more content about the canal than the actual <url>. Does that seem reasonable, to you?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 30:
Text: You removed the border issue coverage in <url>, and your explanation was that it's covered in another article. Where is it covered?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Target Example:
