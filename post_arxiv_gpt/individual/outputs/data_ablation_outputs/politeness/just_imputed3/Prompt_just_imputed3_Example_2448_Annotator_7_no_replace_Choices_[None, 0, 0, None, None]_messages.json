I left Billboard Hot 100 as Billboard Hot 100 because that's the exact name of the chart?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 3:\nText: I'm linking this to Fumiyo's. Are <url> and <url> among the bullies too?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: Maybe the area that is now the Chakma Autonomous District Council was (or is?) located within the Lawngtali district?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 5:\nText: Great work you've been doing on this. Would you agree with me that International Political Economy should be capitalised?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: Vaguely connected, because I don't feel like starting a new section. Have you seen <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 7:\nText: You added partisan colours for the early Chancellors (such as a conservative blue colour for Bismarck); as the early Chancellors were not attached to any political party, and the \"party\" given is merely an approximate indication of their political leanings, I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Also, why did you remove the partisan colour from the last part of the table (the Republic)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 8:\nText: I saw you removed the copyright CSD from Universum University as being \"unclear copyright status\".  What am I missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thank you so much! I hope it's allright if I move it to my front page, at least when the talk has to be archived?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 10:\nText: I am the third party; <url> was the first to dispute its use.  Why can't you describe the changes in words?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 11:\nText: Um, I'll check it out, 141.158.210.110, but I haven't had a lot of edits (if any) on that article. In the mean time, why not <url> and join the Wikipedia community?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: I think it is a great idea to merge my Geraldine Jones article to the flip Wilson show article, but I don't know how to do that. Can you help me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 13:\nText: Thanks for approving my request. Should I remove my request?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 14:\nText: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \"naming\" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: Your \"resolution\" was to move it back to \"Detective Terry Crowley\" again? Why do you keep doing that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 16:\nText: I guess there's a connection to <url> too. Do you think that's cu worthy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 17:\nText: Can you check if there was ever an article for \"Kenneth Eng\"? It seems to have been deleted, if so could you supply me with an archive of the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 18:\nText: And I'm asking for YOUR help, DrachenFyre, to control this vandal <url>'s changes to <url> and <url>.  What do we do with this nut?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 19:\nText: See my comment on the talk page. How did this ever get to DYK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 20:\nText: Hi Bruce, I normally make only trivial changes, but I've just found it necessary to do two hook rewrites. Could you check, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: Hi, although I agree with you, please check the following <url> in process. Why can't the darn thing work, in the first place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 22:\nText: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 23:\nText: What do you think? Is there a mistake somewhere?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 24:\nText: Why did you remove those German emigrant cases. Shouldn't we include those cases of people who was born in what was then Germany at the time?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 25:\nText: Okay, I've read through it, and I'm willing to accept that it's your granddaughter. Shall I delete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: Quite. Do you know why, though?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 27:\nText: It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided.  Do you have any references you can add to the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 28:\nText: Thank you for getting to all those WikiProject Canada assessements so quickly! Question, is it ''useful'' what I'm doing, adding the template even to what I know will be relative low importance articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 29:\nText: This is what you wrote: \"In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times.\" What book, 1948??\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 30:\nText: By the way. Can you edit your own talk page when it is protected?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nTarget Example:\nText: You didn't answer about the status of above mentioned image. Are you going to tag that image too?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
