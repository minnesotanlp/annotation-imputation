The GLAM WIKI conference could do with being highlighed by a non US/UK hook?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 2:\nText: Thanks terribly for looking it up. Would it be alright for me to use the new source in Europe, economy section then?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hey, I just tried to link to Marat Ayin and it came up as a red link. Do you know if we have an article on it and I'm just not using the right transliteration or do we really not have an article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: Are you really denying that you brought Giano and Bishonen's names into this? Seriously?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: The admin says he thinks it should be renamed, but someone else is trying to pull the \"but it happened in the same area nonsense\". Was I clear enough in explaining where the pictures are listed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: You lost me J. I did the edits because I remember you telling me that repeating things that are already in the wiki-link is unneeded and/or redundant. Do you not recall that instance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 7:\nText: Help how? Do you mean disambiguating links like this:<url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: But the main question was that would it be a bad idea to make more articles about characters, orginizations and etc. in a book?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: I'm with you - it really is a friggin' pain that people refuse to read no matter how big you put the text.  Should we just maybe remove the source entirely?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 10:\nText: I apologize if I have misunderstood.  Are you not an acknowledged devotee of Prem Rawat?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: WHADDAFUCK YA GONNA DO TO ME, HUH BITCH!?????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 12:\nText: AnonEMouse, I have noticed today that there are many recent comments on the <url> talk page that do not show in \"history\". How can that happen?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: Especially considering that it took you ''a lot'' more time to vandalize the page than the two seconds it took us to fix it. What's the point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 14:\nText: I'm glad you made things calculate automatically (and I trust you've tested it!). Shouldn't we update the <url> to not show the unneeded variables, then?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: I looked at all the provinces and regencies listed on <url> - so that trick is mostly played out. I'm going down the alphabet now and I'm at the R's - if you want to work, maybe you could start at the end of the alphabet so we don't interfere with each other, meet in the middle?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 16:\nText: I don't see the references anywhere. Do you mean the \"glimcher website\" and \"official website\" links?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: It is disputed among admins regarding the protection of userpages, although the policy says that users can have their user/user sub-pages (but not the talks) semi-protected if the user requests it. Are there other subpages of yours that you'd like protecting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 18:\nText: It just doesn't make sense (to me) that we use a manga spelling for one name but a Simmons' spelling for another. Can't we just go along with Simmons on this one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 19:\nText: Well, lyrics are generally frowned upon on Wikipedia, unless the song is old enough that its copyright no longer applies. Could you perhaps link to the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 20:\nText: Halfling may be another name for Hobbit, but the model for the Hobbit encouraged the creation of other Halflings. Nevertheless it is a Halfling, is it not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: Your bot runs awfully fast. How come there isn't \"using AWB\" in the edit summary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 22:\nText: I couldn't find your \"email user\" function. What's up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 23:\nText: Yet you did violate <url> and could be blocked right now. If that edit recurred, would you revert it again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: APS = <url>. You lost me, which plant are you referring to above?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: In the summer (June-July) I am going to work on the ''Messiah'' article. Would you like to be in on this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: I have just reported a high level of Vandalism at the page <url>. Is it possible to impose a temporary protection to the page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: What is your objection?  Would a split address your concerns?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 28:\nText: That's a <url>-length rant. Still, be nice and AGF, okay?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 29:\nText: Do you understand now what was wrong with your edits? What do you intend to do if unblocked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: I believe it was I who moved it, based on what appeared to be consensus to use the hyphen in that context.  Where is this guideline of which you speak that suggests otherwise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Good day, sorry to bother you. Is the 2:00 am news brief called eyewitness news everynite, and if it is do they play move closer to your world?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
