Example 7:
Text: Remember we had the whole edit warring on Edelsten article a while back? I find it curious that a recently created account posted this <url> as their first contribution basically supporting Edelsten's personal website (which when you look would hardly pass <url>, I looked it at this site a while back in research and found some of the positive claims could not be verified) and wanting a complete rewrite of the article... sound familiar?

What problems are you having ?
