So what do you think--is there enough content in the rangefinding section to make a standalone article, and do I provide enough argument to justify pulling it out, and adding links from <url> and <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: I have unexplained pain.

Perhaps you would wish to review your !vote under the changed circumstances?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: Not sure if you are saying that I am beating a dead horse in raising the inclusion criteria problem again... or if Doncram is doing so in objecting to my doing so again.  Or is it both?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 9:\nText: Hi Finell: I have filed an RfC at <url>.

It's really no big deal, but how can something be both correct and incorrect, and which standard are we at long last supposed to follow?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 13:\nText: Hi, I just had a look at the <url> article and spotted that the link <url> goes to a dab page, are any of the options there the right one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Could you please check over the article of <url>.

What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: I think it is a great idea to merge my Geraldine Jones article to the flip Wilson show article, but I don't know how to do that.
