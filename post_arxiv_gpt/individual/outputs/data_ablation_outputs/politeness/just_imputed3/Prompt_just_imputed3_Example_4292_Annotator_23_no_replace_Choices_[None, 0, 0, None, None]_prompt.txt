Annotation from annotator: 17

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 5:
Text: Why have you included the Putnam Line in the MTA infobox, when it was never operated by the MTA (excepting the Marble Hill stub, which is hardly on a par with the Hudson Line, Harlem Line, etc.)?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 10:
Text: Why did you delete the article on anal stretching????
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 11:
Text: I looked at all the provinces and regencies listed on <url> - so that trick is mostly played out. I'm going down the alphabet now and I'm at the R's - if you want to work, maybe you could start at the end of the alphabet so we don't interfere with each other, meet in the middle?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 12:
Text: Well the only plausible explanation was that you reverted to where I removed an extraneous cat (after Homestarmy's edit) and then swapped out a template... but as you're a competent editor that just seemed odd. Is that what indeed occurred?

Example 16:
Text: "two pigeons in a row constitute a half-wave antenna at 700 MHz" That's a pretty cool intersection of radio invisible waves seems-like-magic and real-life objects! On the other hand, did you perhaps just crack the secret for implementing <url>?

Example 19:
Text: As a timid Wikipedia end-user who never makes more than a rare grammatical or spelling edit, learning the history to be found on this talk page and Kate's userpage history makes me sad. Why is it that so many communities change the way they do as the size of the project they revolve around increases..?

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 21:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 27:
Text: What would the recommended sequencing be, then?... GAR, then FAR?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 28:
Text: Well, I do have one question. If I were to come across a page that I would normally mark as a CSD- like copyright infringement, etc, as an admin can I just delete it or do I need to mark it CSD and ask another opinion?
