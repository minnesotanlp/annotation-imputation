Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 28:
Text: He used it to assert that '''''others''''' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 29:
Text: There may not be a lot of situations like this, but there will definitely be some. I was wondering if there is any kind of invisible comment that can be added to the article in these situations so that the report doesn't include it, or if you have any other thoughts about how it might be possible to handle this situation?
