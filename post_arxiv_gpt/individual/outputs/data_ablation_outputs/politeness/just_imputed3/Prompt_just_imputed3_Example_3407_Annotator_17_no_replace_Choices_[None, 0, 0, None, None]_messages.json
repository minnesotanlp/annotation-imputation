Do we make note of the split-up around 1917 and omit the mention of 1931, or do we make note of the split-up around 1917 and mention that the marriage (may have) lasted until 1931?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 2:\nText: Funny, you could not tell it was me... who else would it be??\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 3:\nText: You said: \"I am just upset that you are harassing a person who seems to be trying to better himself and his relationship with fellow wikipedians.\"  First, I'm harrassing no-one, and it would be better if you didn't make such accusations.  Secondly, what evidence do you see that SS is trying to do anything of the kind?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi, I think that you do a fantastic job on DELSORT. However, I was just wondering if, when you add to Schools, whether you would be good enough to add them to the appropriate section, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 5:\nText: Senta.jpg was garbled or empty or some such, so I deleted it. You might want to try re-uploading?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: ..to Giggy's RfA. Did you mean to remove 2,066 bytes of replies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 7:\nText: You've violated <url> on <url>, with 2 reverts in half an hour. Would you like to revert yourself to avoid being blocked again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hope that you don't mind, I modified your comment in the Craig intro, using a nice new template that I found.  Check it out: what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 9:\nText: I noticed you added the Arabic for <url>'s name. Do you know the <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 10:\nText: Also, all in all, I think Batman should be changed to <url>, not <url>, as the latter refers to those with superhuman powers or abilities, which he lacks. Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: With all due respect, that is going to take ages. How can one create a 'Bot' to do all this for me for <url>, <url>, <url>, <url> and <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 12:\nText: For one phonological citation I need an uppercase \"I\", as in \"Italy\", with _serifs_ to distinguish it from lowercase L.  You advised \"The Classic skin uses a serifed font, if you can accept a personal solution.\"  I'm sorry, I don't catch your meaning.  Where do I find the Classic skin, what is a personal solution, and why wouldn't I accept it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 13:\nText: Thank you, Cremepuff222, for the kind words. :) How have you been?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 14:\nText: Re: your comment at <url>,.

When do you use -?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 16:\nText: Yes, nearly every church category seems messed up, going either up or down. It seems a major task to do the whole lot - would it make sense simply to move the Catholics (say) out of the primate tree (by an edit) or is this bypassing the cfd process in some sneaky fashion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hi Skully, I've been keeping an eye on your edits over the past few weeks, and I think you should be a admin. Is it alright if I nominated you to be an admin?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 18:\nText: Self-follow-up: Also, while sometimes the status quo should be maintained, by supporting it in this case, you're also supporting a \"revert-first, ask questions later\" approach to dealing with good faith edits. Is that really what you want?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 19:\nText: You may need to enable your own setting to allow E-mail too; I'm not sure. If so, maybe you can turn it on temporarily, so that you can send me one e-mail?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 20:\nText: Rxe9nyi leaves out the other gruesome details and adds the context of the fortress.  Do you know which details are in the most widespread and/or original version of this tale?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: Hi there again, just reminding you that the review must be archived over at WP:Biography as well, not only marked as such in the article Talk page.

Meet me there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 28:\nText: Reverted again, you need to create your own subpage at Template talk:Did you know/Article name. If you need some help, I could nominate it for you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 29:\nText: This came up for discussion on <url>. What is the last word on it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: Your bot runs awfully fast. How come there isn't \"using AWB\" in the edit summary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Hi Taivo, I'm beginning to have my suspicions that Fellowscientist might be you-know-who from past debates. Am I being paranoid?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
