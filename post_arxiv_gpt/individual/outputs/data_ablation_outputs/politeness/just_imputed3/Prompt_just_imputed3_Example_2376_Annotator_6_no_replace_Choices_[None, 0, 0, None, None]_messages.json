Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 2:\nText: If people want to know more about her, there's the article on her. Are you really meaning to argue that people could not fully understand the concept of imagism without seeing a picture of HD?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 3:\nText: Yeah, I agree. What's up with that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi again - it looks like the same user is editing out all the information about Destiny being self-centred again. Is there some way we can stop this user from making these edits?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 5:\nText: Oops.  Hmm...yeah...that sounds like a good idea...why not go ahead?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: What do you mean by \"one edit war away\"? And whats a siteban?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 7:\nText: In fact, what I'd like to propose here is that we take a bit more control, establish some stricter edit warring restrictions, unprotect the page, slap up an edit notice, and enforce them with blocks so that people can get back to writing the article. Do you think that would have a positive effect?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hello. Can you please pass the pilot whale article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 9:\nText: And now you undid my declination of that one which was copyrighted.

How did you come upon this matter?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hmm...it appears to be an infobox at the moment and lacking in any content other than that. Have you done a search for the battle at all?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 13:\nText: If you read the <url> article, you'll see that the locos were rebuilt. Is it possible that the E1 class were the rebuilds of the 118 class?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 14:\nText: Something's still not right with me here. Think you can perform one of those cleanups?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 15:\nText: Ok. Thank you for clarifying. Could you be more specific as to what you are specifying as \"the claim\" so that I may find relevant information to refute?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 16:\nText: Upon further thought, maybe I could look through lists of deleted articles to see if any interest me and see if I can bring them back (with adequate sourcing). Do you know anything about that process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hey, doesn't look like anyone at <url> are concerned about our move proposition? Could you close the request, and move the article back to <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 18:\nText: thank you. but, what should i do now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 19:\nText: Hi Khoikhoi - I see you deleted a previous incarnation of a pan-Arabism article which seems to be resurfacing under variant names, and is now at <url>.

What is that template?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 22:\nText: It was based on the comments <url>. Do you have reason to believe otherwise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 23:\nText: APS = <url>. You lost me, which plant are you referring to above?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: You asked for help? What help do you need?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 25:\nText: Despite our long-standing disagreement, I have no argument with you <url>. However, can I suggest you use a less opaque edit summary than  ''added info'' when doing something that is nonetheless controversial?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: When I look at the stats on the <url> wiki page I only see 55 Major appearances from 1972 onwards. I'm going by the assumption that page is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 27:\nText: now???\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 28:\nText: I disagree that it fits the description perfectly, but that aside...it doesn't indicate that the move is \"signature\" or that she has ever used it before.

Am I to take this as a sign you are no longer willing to discuss the issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 30:\nText: Hey, I think that perhaps Raleigh Park should redirct to <url> rather the the Nottingham halls of residece article. Do you agree?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Do you think we're good to go with the proposal, maybe later tonight, or tomorrow? Any other problems with the proposal as it stands?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
