Example 14:
Text: Hi- The Magnificent Clean-keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of "notability" as the reason. Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of "notability" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point?

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 18:
Text: (after multipled edit conflicts)I checked your behaviour and your contributions myself at the time, as did numerous other admins who reviewed your edits and the block and it was subject of extensive discussion on and off-site so your suggestion that I should have checked with others is silly. You violated Wikipedia's policies and were blocked rightly for it; you've been given a second chance and instead of being productive you come here to moan about a comment I made more than six months ago, that I still stand by, and to pursue your now year-old vendetta against Nick?
