Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 15:
Text: True, and you're right. But it does define it, so doesn't that mean it shouldn't have a comma?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 16:

Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 17:
Text: Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 26:
Text: I note that you've edited since this was brought up here. Could you please respond?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 27:

Example 2:
Text: But I don't know anything about central europe. Have you tried the normal dispute resolution avenues?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 8:
Text: I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 13:
Text: I don't understand why Hong is so reluctant to revert unilateral changes from time-to-time when he did so frequently in the past when I or someone else who supported my edits did it. What exactly is the point in me agreeing to this if someone conveniently comes along and then starts making lots of changes that I don't like but Giovanni doesn't mind?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 14:
Text: You're a troll. Why not go somewhere else?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 15:
Text: eh, i've ALWAYS hated 50 meter pools (200 butterfly was always the BIGGEST pain in the ass) although i really did like butterfly for some reason.... never quite got that, so was it an indoor or outdoor pool????

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 20:

Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 24:
Text: It may very well have been a better candidate for a stub rather than a speedy deletion. I would rather not talk about this on another users talk page, if you would like to discuss if further could we continue any further posts on <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 25:
Text: Is there any way I could talk you into being more conservative with creation of new articles?  Do you agree that some of what you're creating here would be seen as obviously deletable material by most editors?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 26:
Text: The above username has been indefinitely banned as a phishing account. Now why would they want my login details...?

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 30:
Text: I've deleted the old versions of ''Winnie the Pooh'' and ''Prom'', but I haven't deleted the other two yet: on the ''Elite Force'' image, the image you've uploaded says "Mac" on the box, while the description says it's for the PC; and the external link supplied for the ''127 Hours'' poster shows the original image that was here. Shouldn't these be made consistent first?
