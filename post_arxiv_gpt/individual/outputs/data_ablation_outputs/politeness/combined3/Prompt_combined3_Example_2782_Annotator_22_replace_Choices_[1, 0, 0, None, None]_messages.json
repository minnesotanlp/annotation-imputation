Does that somehow make it more ok?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 2:\nText: Please sign comments using four tildes, as I'm not sure who you are...? Which article are you speaking about?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 3:\nText: I've been called a British unionist, Devolutionist & Irish Nationalist, over the years. Not bad, eh?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 4:\nText: But if there is no evidence that it has been downgraded, shouldn't it be kept as a Cat. 2?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 5:\nText: OK, I retract this completely: the IP hopper in question should...well, I'm biting my tongue. Have you reported them for vandalism, with their half a dozen IP addresses?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: CW, you are aware that Lebanon isn't Hezbollah, right? In the same way that Ireland isn't the IRA?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 7:\nText: Just noticed that the \"time\" field is eliminated from the collapsable boxes. Could you make this something that is displayed when the box is expanded?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 8:\nText: Is it really a hoax?  While I don't doubt it in the least, could you provide other AfD voters with the evidence that led you to this conclusion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 9:\nText: Alright, I don't like it but is not worth wasting more time on, but (as you now noticed as well) if it ''really'' had been deleted for <url>, it would have been truly problematic. Can I just ask: ''if'' Mephistophelian would return, are we allowed to undelete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 10:\nText: O RLY? And what does it do there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 11:\nText: A long time ago, you deleted this article. How can I see the content previously in the discussion page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 12:\nText: Other than that I think the artical is ready to go. What say you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 13:\nText: My edit on <url> was written by me, not copied from a forum. Out of curiousity, which forum copied my post on Wikipedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: Figures as much. What's wrong with it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 15:\nText: |style=\"vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;\" | For creating an article on a relatively obscure bridge with interesting information that remains in the current article, which has become the focus of the world for all the wrong reasons, I hereby award you this oddball barnstar. Who knew all this could happen?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 16:\nText: thank you very much for your patience and for listening. how do you think is the best way to resolve these issues?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 17:\nText: As a rough look over, the splits look ok to me (although yes, more discussion before forking is generally a good thing). If you think there are serious problems with them, why not just address it on the talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 18:\nText: I don't play club anymore (I stopped this year), I have just been too busy this year, but I will probably start again soon-ish. Where abouts do you play?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 19:\nText: Indeed. I trust you have already watchlisted this editor?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 20:\nText: Can I ask: was this really the implication that you intended in making this change?  And do you really think the RfC expressed consensus support for such a position?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 21:\nText: Are you calling me a vandal for visiting your user page?  Or am I just <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: No worries - the only thing I see holding up promotion is whether the ejectionsite website qualifies as a <url> or not. Can you tell me if the author's work has been cited elsewhere (like in books) or he is considered to be an expert in the field?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 23:\nText: Just asking one quick question since it'll probably be asked at RfA. Do you know the difference between a block and a ban?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 24:\nText: Yes, I posted a link to the history. I was asking/thinking where you stepped into the discussion and if you were editing as an IP and that would put a different slant on your 3rr warning to Bbb23?, have you been recently editing the article was the simple question?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Further, one may ask why there is no proto-tumour-suppressor. Could it be because tumour-suppressors were discovered later, when mechanisms were better understood?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 26:\nText: Most of the editors who would care about the deletion of KiK's threads are the ones who would agree with him, so it's pointless to warn them.  Hell ... come to think of it, hasn't KiK been all over their talk pages, with them high-fiving each other?\nAnnotation from annotator: 2\n\nExample 27:\nText: Cool, Thanks, do you want to add it to their list? or can I?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 28:\nText: I thought this problem (non-Latin characters being changed to ??????? when people edit in certain browsers) had been fixed, but maybe there are browsers out there that don't support Unicode even with the fix?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 29:\nText: I thought that, when some informations are mentioned about in ''desperate housewives'', it is a reliable source? So, in your way of thinking, Susan Mayer maiden name is not Bremmer or something like that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: I'm sorry, but I don't have time at the moment - my dissertation is calling my name. Have you tried any of the other <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Excellent, thanks! I wonder if it's worth temporarily uploading a cropped image for the main page, as 100x100 is really very small?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 2:\nText: Your recent post to the straw poll at <url> may need some clarification. Did you intend \"support going to Arbcomm\" to be a vote for the \"Death\" entry?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 3:\nText: What would the recommended sequencing be, then?... GAR, then FAR?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've read everything again, and I still think it's the right decision. What I'm confused about is if you claim that <url> does not care about capitalisation, how do you explain <url>, <url> and <url> (examples given on the talk page)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: Are you kidding me? Do you even bother to click on <url> to see its fleet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 6:\nText: No worries, thanks for doing that. Nice to hear from you again - new username for 2013?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 7:\nText: Meh - perhaps not, and they will most likely be closed as renames, but I figured another week to allow anyone who wants to to comment wouldn't hurt anything since you as the nominator were the only one who had commented so far. Is there something I missed, or a hurry to get these quickly renamed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 8:\nText: Don't add any more trash to the article. Got it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 9:\nText: Although Singapore does not use Traditional Chinese, I still think we should at least add Traditional Chinese titles for shows not made by Mediacorp, and bought from overseas (mainly Hong Kong) TV stations. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 10:\nText: I don't like the idea of switching the order halfway through, especially as you would you have to decide an arbitrary cut-off point. Perhaps you should raise this on <url>, and see what people think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: Hi GW.. I was a bit bored today, so I made this: <url>.. What do you think so far?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 12:\nText: Is this really notable?  Time for an AfD nom?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: I see a \"remove protection\" tab on the <url>, which tells an admin that the article is protected.  Are you still able to edit it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 14:\nText: I did not have intention to put the username signature into any article. Where did you find it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 15:\nText: why can't you use corporate authorship? if Deutsche Bank can claim ownership of those emails can't Charter 97 claim ownership of the picture?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 16:\nText: So you deny you did anything wrong Jason?  And we're all Nazi's persecuting you, Itake and Uncle Davey?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 17:\nText: If it works consistently, a printonly abbreviation would make sense. But how many editors would actually see that form to catch problems should they arise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 18:\nText: Another admin has already deleted the article. Do you need me to restore it for you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 19:\nText: That \"guest\" could have been an undercover Colbert staff member and the whole segment could have been staged. Otherwise, why would Colbert have taken 3 minutes out of his show to talk to someone in the audience?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 20:\nText: Hi, I have opened a discussion at <url>. Perhaps you would like to contribute?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 21:\nText: Whatever works. I trust that you'll do what ya gotta do, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 22:\nText: An issue has been raised at <url> about this article, which you created. Maybe you can clear up the confusion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 23:\nText: Hi there, I've found some peer-reviewed publications that discuss Hoser's work. Could you take another look at the article and the AfD discussion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 24:\nText: I thought I had explained it pretty clearly.  What part did you disagree with?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 25:\nText: I need to read more about what exactly a pastoral opera is supposed to be. Perhaps it should be a supercategory?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 26:\nText: I'm not sure what you mean by the old factory farming discussion. Is something missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 27:\nText: Thanks for the help! That info should be on <url> in easy to read form, no?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 28:\nText: I apologize if I have misunderstood.  Are you not an acknowledged devotee of Prem Rawat?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 29:\nText: I removed the hyphen from \"oldest-known\", which is hard to see if you aren't looking for it. Does that answer the question?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 30:\nText: I don't think it is too unreasonable to archive messages you have read by deleting them - they are still available in the page history. Is there a policy guideline that they should be archived, and not deleted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Leon Liebgold played a rabbi. Was he a rabbi?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
