Estimated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: Hi, I reverted vandalism on a couple of your subpages that you transclude in your main userpage. Do you want me to semi-protect them (your subpages) so that it is more difficult for vandals to subtly vandalize you?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 2:

Text: I've been running into your super stub articles while organizing a category. Are these all FOIA requests?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 7:
Text: I read the article and can see where it already addresses some of his reliabilty issues. I guess that as long as it was clear that the quotes were from his autobiography and if any other info on the lack of collaboration (from the intro or foreword of the new edition of his autobiography) were included, I think it would be OK. Is there a lot of material to add that is only in his autobiography?

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 11:
Text: Hi there, it looks like the moving editor has added a bunch of references to the talk page supporting the fact Toto is no longer formally referred to as Moorland Totilas.  Do you think if we added one or more of the refs he's added on the talk page to the article we could move it back?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Text: I'm sorry, but I don't see the value in having different criteria for two versions of the same list, one sorted by name and one sorted by nationality. Every other list and article on space travel uses the altitude definition, why would the sub-list sorted by nationality be different?
Annotation from annotator: 8

I don't know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice?
