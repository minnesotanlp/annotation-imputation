What I'm confused about is if you claim that <url> does not care about capitalisation, how do you explain <url>, <url> and <url> (examples given on the talk page)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 2:\nText: I think I'll leave it to the Math WikiProject to decide whether the dab page should be at <url> or <url> since they'll be more familiar with the importance of the various functions.  It looks like all of the basic options I was considering are basically OK from the perspective of the DAB project, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 3:\nText: Since your tube station articles don't actually contain any information, what is the point of them? Why not put them together and work them into an article that says something interesting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi Editorofthewiki,  both images are just fine.  I don't see an open review for the article; is there somewhere in particular you'd like me to make this comment, if not just here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 5:\nText: Did you upload ''Image:1111.jpg'' to make a point about censorship? What exactly is your intention with that image?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 6:\nText: If you keep your eyes focused on the moving toe you can usually catch each instance when you change the rotation direction, I think? Does that tell you anything?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 7:\nText: I have a quick question for you (I'm asking now since I am sure that this is going to be brought up either at the ACR or the FAC, when I finally get there): you've added a \"pp.\" for the citation given for the national defense authorization act of 2007, but the rest of the article makes use of the \"p.\" system. Shouldn't the \"pp.\" be changed to a \"p.\" for conformity, or is the use of the \"pp.\" correct from the perspective of citation guidelines?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm not sure I understand what this has to do with what I said.  Could you restate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 9:\nText: <url>. So, when people click <url>, where do they expect to be taken?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 10:\nText: If there are no objections by the end of the day (1600UTC), I'll overturn the ban. That sound ok?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: I often work out of Sweden and I have an excellent, free, built-in English or Swedish grammar ''and'' spelling program in ''Word'' on that computer using Firefox (as this user says she does) - red underlinings for spelling and green for grammar - which would preclude almost all of the huge amount of problems caused by this user regarding readability, or at least alert her to the very quanitity of the problems and inspire a constructive attitude as to her own capacity. Perhaps if one does not consider it a \"duty\" of sorts to contribute readable English here, that actually might be the problem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 12:\nText: I noticed that you are the major contributor to the articles. Mind if I nominate <url> at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 13:\nText: I guess I must have misunderstood, sorry for that. Exactly what do you mean by having my promise to not use the tools for a year enforced by a bureaucrat?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: How strange - you're apparently credited with its creation at <url>. Do you know who did create the image, by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 15:\nText: Hi. I stumbled upon your user page and was wondering if you could offer any tips for creating locator maps... where do you get the 'base' map and what program do you use to fill in the colours?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 16:\nText: Hi, I understand that the WP:COI rules would still apply, regardless of username. Could you kindly approve the change in my user name from cecn to funshine?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 17:\nText: last msg ???\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 18:\nText: I agree with Deb. Is there anything else you are interested in besides city planning?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 19:\nText: Thanks! :) So we're allowed to do multiple revdels at a time now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 20:\nText: Why would you doubt that. And for that matter why wouldn't you rewrite it yourself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 21:\nText: Is as usual being overrun with pointless blather. Would you like to set up a subpage to discuss sources?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: I'm not too familiar with the google hits thing.  What does it mean when a site has this \"136k\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: Hello. Who are you, and when are we to have met or communicated in the past?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: I understand the problem with that redundant category--I've hashed that out, I think--but why did you remove ALL categories from the Christian shows? That seems....excessive... Or do I just need a nap?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sorry??? Which comment are you referring to?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 26:\nText: It isn't clear to me that he knew WHO Amorrow was, someone has left a message that will hopefully set him straight. Do you have a link to the blog?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 27:\nText: You added the name Ken Taylor to the <url> page but there is no such person listed on the DOD website as having received that award. Who were you refering to?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: Also, someone suggested merging it with another hoax page. Why wasn't that option considered?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 29:\nText: He used it to assert that '''''others''''' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: Well, I'll review it anyhow, and we'll see where we need to go.  Deal?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nHuman-Rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Respectfully, you've replied to the message below mine a day ago now. Could you provide guidance for my request please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 2:\nText: I would advise against creating seperate articles for individual characters and stick to the list. Is this what you'd expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: I don't want to be your enemy. What can I do to help this situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 4:\nText: Not exactly clear what you mean: Wisconsin CDPs are just like CDPs in the rest of the country, and they already have <url>.  Or do you mean something that I'm missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: Huaiwei,  there is this guy HkCaGu who insist that we shouldnt put Tianjin as one of Xiamen Airline's destination from Singapore just because it passes by Xiamen(MF's HUB) however, this is a direct flight from singapore to tianjin via xiamen. what are your views?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: One deleteable article at a time, please.  This is a <url> G4;  do you agree, and if not, why not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Just wondering, is there any reason why you removed categories from a number of articles and replaced them with the non-existend <url>. Wouldn't <url> have been the better choice, which, as it appears, is a category you yourself created a few days ago?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: This is what you wrote: \"In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times.\" What book, 1948??\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: The specific claim of Boyer's that you included and I deleted was that \"cauchy based infinitesimals on limits\".  Did you see anybody else saying this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: I was wondering why I couldn't edit the list of micronations article to correct the alphabetical order. was I blocked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: Thank you for deleting the attack page I tagged.  Should <url> be blocked for creating it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 12:\nText: Regarding <person>, you've made this a Beta - In Use template since January. Is there any hope of making it live at some point in the near future?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 13:\nText: Can you help with this user: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Wallak I suspect that it is sockpuppet of banned user Bonaparte and he vandalizing various articles related to Romanians and Vlachs. Can we do something about it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 14:\nText: Did you notice his recommendation that you do the same?  Let's both take a break, ok?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: Regarding <url>: <url> seems to say the exact opposite (that links on a dab page should ''not'' be through redirects). The page is at <url>, so shouldn't that be how it's linked on the dab page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: What is your take on <url>?  And is there a guideline or policy stated somewhere that covers this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 17:\nText: Yes, I have. Did you really need to send me a reminder?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 18:\nText: Given the comments <url> (saying that Ganglia also should be added to the bypass list), and the fact that there are about 10 WMF projects, wouldn't it be more effective if there was only a \"whitelist\" for adding the WMF projects (which all have a secure version), such as Wikipedia, Wikiversity, Wikinews, Wiktionary, etc? Or would there be some drawbacks in doing this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 19:\nText: \"a low straggling house\" whose rooms were \"pretty and decorated xe0 la franxe7aise\" ...two of the 19th-century NYTimes citations you removed are the sources for the quotations cited here ... now the quotations don't have references. Would you please put them back?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: Erica, I understand you are a figure skating enthusiast. Are you still active in those types of articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: The page is getting smacked literally every half minute or so, and I think the joke's worn thin. Give us a break?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 22:\nText: Where did you learn English? How come you're taking on a third language?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 23:\nText: Just wondering why removed death material? Perhaps another article on his death and circumstances- legacy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: The logo gallery on the <url> article is acting very strange. Can you help me with this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: I'll unblock you if you give me some confirmation you've understood this and you are prepared to discuss the article through the proper channels, calmly and politely. So, cool down please, okay?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: Hi Emily!  Do you have any ideas about a topic yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: I tried to create a similar map for Canada but couldn't get a usable output from the site you used for the Australia map. Could you create a Canadian one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 28:\nText: Question: Is the purpose of the name parameter to show the name of the person as listed at the linked site, or is it to write in whatever the editor thinks he name should be shown as (i.e. damn the sources)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: yes, but we are hardly debating that edit that hasnt stood in the last few days anywway and certainly isnt an issue right now. What of that edit do you currently object to with such vehemence?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 30:\nText: I have noticed that you added the reference to him living in NZ. Do you know anymore?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Is <url> what you're referring to??  '''''One''''' autograph page that he deleted almost '''''five months''''' ago and you're now attacking him as if he deleted every single autograph book ever?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
