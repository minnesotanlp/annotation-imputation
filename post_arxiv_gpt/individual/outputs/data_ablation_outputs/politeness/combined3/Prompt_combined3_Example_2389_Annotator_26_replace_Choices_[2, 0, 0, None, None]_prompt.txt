Estimated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: Errr, okay.  But let's make sure our answers are accurate by using <url> rather than something we heard someone say, eh?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 2:
Text: I'm not sure if you've changed your opinion of the article's FAC status, but I think you have guided us in a ton of good ideas.  Have you changed your opinion?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 3:
Text: Well, yes, obviously (but I sort of assumed that the same exemptions would apply to 1RR as 3RR - is that not the case?) Should I self-rv?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 4:
Text: Steineresque! Shall I have a go, or will you?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 5:
Text: Actually, if she is releasing a new single from the debut album, the title "Home Run" wouldn't encompass this. Someone else has changed it to "Debut album" which I think is more suiting, what do you think?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 6:
Text: I think it's a great idea to get the CO3 community involved with keeping <url> correct and uptodate.  I shan't be there myself this year (clashes with various things) - would you be able to bring it up?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 7:
Text: Unfortunately I think <url> may also add that material; I am not familiar with Citizendum, though, but I will look at it. If Citizendum has the same policies regarding primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, then why not criticize both Wikipedia and Citizendum?

Example 8:
Text: Do you sign your name using 4 tildes? (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>)?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 9:
Text: You know, occasionally, Momoricks will send me a note telling how one of my snarkier edit summaries made her laugh. Is that the case for the triple-misspell revert I did?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 10:
Text: Emico, you have to understand that sometimes people use different words to describe the same thing. If I find a source saying "Hitler killed himself" and I write "Hitler committed suicide" am I wrong because the word ''suicide'' isn't in the sources?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 11:
Text: Are you sure that you want to withdraw your nomination to delete the 2 old articles? Don't you want the 2 articles deleted since they have been merged into something much better?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 12:
Text: I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the "sh" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 13:
Text: I agree with you in that this chapter has no place on <url>, moreover its inclusion there seems highly suspicious. Is there any way to see who added a particular word/sentence/paragraph without manually going through the history?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 14:
Text: I find it done both ways on the web.  If some convention requires capitalizing it even though it's not anything like a proper noun, I think that should get explained in the article, otherwise reasonable people will wonder who it's named after: someone named Saros, but what's his first name and where's the Wikipedia article about him?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 15:
Text: Denied. I take it then that you deny responsiblity for an account (which I'll not name here) created just four minutes after you made that edit?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 16:
Text: I have put another warning on <url> with full details of the vandalism. Can this be reported to London Grid, please?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 20:
Text: I was just about to point that out. Is that permitted?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 21:
Text: Are you both "Dribblingscribe" and "Indiestu" ? Do both those accounts belong to the same person?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 22:
Text: Could possibly be. Have you tagged any of the non-free images for review?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 23:
Text: This is my first time at review-sorry if I blew it.  The article passes just fine--what do I do at DYK to indicate that?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 24:
Text: Thanks for the redactions :). Is it worth getting a third opinion at the reliable sources noticeboard vis a vis the use of law textbooks for points of law?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 25:
Text: How does it feel being wikifamous??
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 26:
Text: I'm gonna go ahead and do it. Thoughts before I proceed?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Text: Thanks.  Is Brazil4Linux doing anything particully bad right now?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 28:
Text: Noticed your nice ''<url>'' photograph. Perhaps you were on the Siruvani bird survey ?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 29:
Text: You are obviously very busy. How should I proceed?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 30:
Text: Why am I never asked to write a feature. Is it because "I is black"?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 2:
Text: But I don't know anything about central europe. Have you tried the normal dispute resolution avenues?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 3:
Text: Hmm, well I'll see before judging.  Does it also allow them to be listed from newest-to-oldest and separated into Russian and English references?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 4:
Text: I'm not sure I understand what this has to do with what I said.  Could you restate?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 5:
Text: Hi, I found two sources which state that <url> was still married and when she moved to Harlem with her Husband. Do you have any sources to the contrary?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 6:
Text: Okay, I will be glad to help you here! Could you please list the username you would want now?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 7:
Text: Miten sxe4 osaat nii hyvin suomee jos sun xe4idinkieli on kumminki englanti? Onks sul suomenkieliset vanhemmat tai jotai vai ootsxe4 vaa opiskellu ite tosi paljo suomee?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 8:
Text: I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 9:
Text: Yes, and there has been a user from an AOL IP who has been trolling Pilotguy for weeks. Why must you blindly disagree with everything anyone says to you?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 10:
Text: I give that a huge second. Why haven't you signed onto the wikiproject yet?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 11:
Text: Stephen's solution certainly isn't optimal. Fancy giving me a basic rundown on the problem here and I'll see if I can devise a more elegant one?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 12:
Text: <url> has a discussion (well kinda right now, I'm still waiting for the initiator to actually explain himself) about the fair use strength of images on episode lists (why there and not on <url>'s talk page is beyond me.  Care to chime in?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 13:
Text: I don't understand why Hong is so reluctant to revert unilateral changes from time-to-time when he did so frequently in the past when I or someone else who supported my edits did it. What exactly is the point in me agreeing to this if someone conveniently comes along and then starts making lots of changes that I don't like but Giovanni doesn't mind?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 14:
Text: You're a troll. Why not go somewhere else?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 15:
Text: eh, i've ALWAYS hated 50 meter pools (200 butterfly was always the BIGGEST pain in the ass) although i really did like butterfly for some reason.... never quite got that, so was it an indoor or outdoor pool????
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 16:

Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 17:
Text: Yes, I apologize, my friend (I guess I have some kind of a phobia that you will forget about my posts :) ) I will wait as long as you want me to. Could you read Mir Harven's posts on talk page?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 18:
Text: SPI is not for just simple yes no answers. Why did you not warn the Minneapolis IP, they are warring as much as Bb23?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 19:
Text: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 20:
Text: The links were removed but, what rule says it is best to "double space"? And what do you plan to rewrite exactly?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 21:
Text: No problem, done. What's your connection to Casey?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 22:
Text: Thank you very much for your kind comments but I don't recall if or when I made these contributions. Are you sure it was me?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 23:
Text: Thanks a lot for clearing that up. Do you also happen to know about the age of consent in Thailand, and why he could be charge with child sex offenses even though she was 17 years old?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 24:
Text: It may very well have been a better candidate for a stub rather than a speedy deletion. I would rather not talk about this on another users talk page, if you would like to discuss if further could we continue any further posts on <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 25:
Text: Is there any way I could talk you into being more conservative with creation of new articles?  Do you agree that some of what you're creating here would be seen as obviously deletable material by most editors?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 26:
Text: The above username has been indefinitely banned as a phishing account. Now why would they want my login details...?

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 29:
Text: See: <url>. If I remember correctly, you said you planned on cleaning up after the bot tagged the images; is that still the case?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 30:
Text: I've deleted the old versions of ''Winnie the Pooh'' and ''Prom'', but I haven't deleted the other two yet: on the ''Elite Force'' image, the image you've uploaded says "Mac" on the box, while the description says it's for the PC; and the external link supplied for the ''127 Hours'' poster shows the original image that was here. Shouldn't these be made consistent first?
