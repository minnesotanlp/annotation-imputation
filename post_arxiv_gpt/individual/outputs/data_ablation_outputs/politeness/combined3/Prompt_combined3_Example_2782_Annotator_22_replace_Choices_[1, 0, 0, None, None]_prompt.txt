Estimated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: Oh that's charming, so instead of making a personal attack on a single editor you made it on a class of editors. Does that somehow make it more ok?
Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 2:
Text: Please sign comments using four tildes, as I'm not sure who you are...? Which article are you speaking about?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 3:
Text: I've been called a British unionist, Devolutionist & Irish Nationalist, over the years. Not bad, eh?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Annotation from annotator: 19

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 6:
Text: CW, you are aware that Lebanon isn't Hezbollah, right? In the same way that Ireland isn't the IRA?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 9:
Text: Alright, I don't like it but is not worth wasting more time on, but (as you now noticed as well) if it ''really'' had been deleted for <url>, it would have been truly problematic. Can I just ask: ''if'' Mephistophelian would return, are we allowed to undelete it?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 10:
Text: O RLY? And what does it do there?
Annotation from annotator: 0

Example 11:

Example 12:
Text: Other than that I think the artical is ready to go. What say you?
Annotation from annotator: 23

Example 13:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 15:
Text: |style="vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid gray;" | For creating an article on a relatively obscure bridge with interesting information that remains in the current article, which has become the focus of the world for all the wrong reasons, I hereby award you this oddball barnstar. Who knew all this could happen?

Example 16:
Text: thank you very much for your patience and for listening. how do you think is the best way to resolve these issues?
Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 17:
Text: As a rough look over, the splits look ok to me (although yes, more discussion before forking is generally a good thing). If you think there are serious problems with them, why not just address it on the talk page?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 18:
Text: I don't play club anymore (I stopped this year), I have just been too busy this year, but I will probably start again soon-ish. Where abouts do you play?

Text: Indeed. I trust you have already watchlisted this editor?
Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 20:
Text: Can I ask: was this really the implication that you intended in making this change?  And do you really think the RfC expressed consensus support for such a position?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 21:
Text: Are you calling me a vandal for visiting your user page?  Or am I just <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 22:
Text: No worries - the only thing I see holding up promotion is whether the ejectionsite website qualifies as a <url> or not. Can you tell me if the author's work has been cited elsewhere (like in books) or he is considered to be an expert in the field?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 23:
Text: Just asking one quick question since it'll probably be asked at RfA. Do you know the difference between a block and a ban?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 24:
Text: Yes, I posted a link to the history. I was asking/thinking where you stepped into the discussion and if you were editing as an IP and that would put a different slant on your 3rr warning to Bbb23?, have you been recently editing the article was the simple question?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 25:
Text: Further, one may ask why there is no proto-tumour-suppressor. Could it be because tumour-suppressors were discovered later, when mechanisms were better understood?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 26:
Text: Most of the editors who would care about the deletion of KiK's threads are the ones who would agree with him, so it's pointless to warn them.  Hell ... come to think of it, hasn't KiK been all over their talk pages, with them high-fiving each other?
Annotation from annotator: 2

Example 27:

Annotation from annotator: 24

Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 29:
Text: I thought that, when some informations are mentioned about in ''desperate housewives'', it is a reliable source? So, in your way of thinking, Susan Mayer maiden name is not Bremmer or something like that?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 22

Text: Your recent post to the straw poll at <url> may need some clarification. Did you intend "support going to Arbcomm" to be a vote for the "Death" entry?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 3:
Text: What would the recommended sequencing be, then?... GAR, then FAR?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 4:
Text: I've read everything again, and I still think it's the right decision. What I'm confused about is if you claim that <url> does not care about capitalisation, how do you explain <url>, <url> and <url> (examples given on the talk page)?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 5:
Text: Are you kidding me? Do you even bother to click on <url> to see its fleet?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 7:
Text: Meh - perhaps not, and they will most likely be closed as renames, but I figured another week to allow anyone who wants to to comment wouldn't hurt anything since you as the nominator were the only one who had commented so far. Is there something I missed, or a hurry to get these quickly renamed?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 8:
Text: Don't add any more trash to the article. Got it?
Annotation from annotator: 1

Example 9:
Text: Although Singapore does not use Traditional Chinese, I still think we should at least add Traditional Chinese titles for shows not made by Mediacorp, and bought from overseas (mainly Hong Kong) TV stations. What do you think?
Annotation from annotator: 22

Example 10:
Text: I don't like the idea of switching the order halfway through, especially as you would you have to decide an arbitrary cut-off point. Perhaps you should raise this on <url>, and see what people think?

Annotation from annotator: 20

Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 19:

Example 24:
Text: I thought I had explained it pretty clearly.  What part did you disagree with?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 29:

Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 30:
Text: I don't think it is too unreasonable to archive messages you have read by deleting them - they are still available in the page history. Is there a policy guideline that they should be archived, and not deleted?
