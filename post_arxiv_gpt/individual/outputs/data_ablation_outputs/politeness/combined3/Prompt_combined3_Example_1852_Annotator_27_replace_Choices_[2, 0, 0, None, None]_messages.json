Do you want me to semi-protect them (your subpages) so that it is more difficult for vandals to subtly vandalize you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: <url> as having been deleted via a deletion discussion, however I can't find any such Afd. Do you know of one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hey, when do we add games for the EHF Champion League and the Basketball EuroLeague into the portal? And NFL every week?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: Good find. Do you have a cite for the second para?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: I noticed that the bot is now using the duplicate template instead of the db-redundantimage template.  Is there a reason for the switch?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 6:\nText: I've been running into your super stub articles while organizing a category. Are these all FOIA requests?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: I read the article and can see where it already addresses some of his reliabilty issues. I guess that as long as it was clear that the quotes were from his autobiography and if any other info on the lack of collaboration (from the intro or foreword of the new edition of his autobiography) were included, I think it would be OK. Is there a lot of material to add that is only in his autobiography?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: Thats good. Do you have any enemies on here as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: The discussion page at <url> does not note that semi-protection has been removed. Would you be willing to note your action there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Is as usual being overrun with pointless blather. Would you like to set up a subpage to discuss sources?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 11:\nText: Hi there, it looks like the moving editor has added a bunch of references to the talk page supporting the fact Toto is no longer formally referred to as Moorland Totilas.  Do you think if we added one or more of the refs he's added on the talk page to the article we could move it back?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: <url> shows that Geo Swan has become active and <url> indicates that the problems mentioned at the RfC may be continuing. Would you close the RfC with the drafted summary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 13:\nText: I'm sorry, but I don't see the value in having different criteria for two versions of the same list, one sorted by name and one sorted by nationality. Every other list and article on space travel uses the altitude definition, why would the sub-list sorted by nationality be different?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: He's back <url>, <url> as <url>.  Also, in the future would you rather me just post these to <url>, or do you just want to continue handeling him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: Die Person, die Probleme macht, ist jetzt in Schwierigkeiten. Vielleicht seit langem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: Likewise there is some discussion at <url>, where <url> is categorising itself and its documenttation. Could you please fix that as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hi David, you're good with images. Anything you can do to clean up <url> so it's useful on ITN?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Hi Skully, I've been keeping an eye on your edits over the past few weeks, and I think you should be a admin. Is it alright if I nominated you to be an admin?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 19:\nText: Fatwa?  What is that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: <url>! Shall we greet him as he deserves?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: Wanted to Email you about Wikimedia Converence Netherlands, but your email is not working. In any case, you could crash at our place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 22:\nText: If I were to find information on the typical age of instance for hyperparthyroism/OFC, what section would that fall under? Epidemology?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 23:\nText: Not a whole lot of contrast with the letters now, if you've traversed the link.  Maybe a green pattern is just not the right base color, if we are trying to avoid confusing with WP officialstuff?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: <url> Am I missing something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sorry, but i do not find \"double torpedo tunnels\" to be very good. Can you come up with something better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: Thanks for doing the tidy up on the SSC page.  One question, what was the reason for removing the item about the Simon PG ownership of the buildings, as well as dropping the link to the company's WP entry?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: You recently reverted both these pages with the reason \"not in the linked article\". I'm just curious, what does \"not in the linked article\" actually mean?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 28:\nText: Are you unable to pee with a half filled bladder???\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 29:\nText: There's a nice section on funerals <url> but I'm not given a look at the contributors' page (p. 673) to see who J.B. is. Any chance your access is different?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: right but in this case, the certain artist goes by a different name now, so people would most likely type in ''\"diddy\"'' instead of the other old one. like if somebody changes their name or alias, and people wont know where theyre listed in?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nHuman-Rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Hi, I noticed on <url> you mentioned its Alexa traffic rank.  How do you find out the Alexa traffic rank of something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: Can you take a look at the article <url> and the conversation going on at <url> (that should probably be moved to the article talk page).  Your thoughts on the most recent commentary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hi there, I always thought <url> was originally AE&CI, not AE&I.  Do you have a reference for AE&I?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: <url> reminded me of a report I want to file about Asad. May I?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: ... is discouraged, but should redirects be created for situations like <url>? Inclusively, I believe you once told me that something like <url> should be changed per the guideline?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: Hey Mvjs, I was wondering if you could prove me somewhat sane.

The text is drawn from the books listed; do you feel any particular statement needs verifying?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: I clearly provided a source that is valid, and yet a couple of hours is a big deal? Is it your way, or the highway?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: I was just looking again at the April Fool's pranks from this year and came upon <url> to a page you deleted per \"housecleaning\".  Can we undelete and move it somewhere (the latter only if necessary), tagging with <url> in the process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: How do I sign up to volunteer for the Missing TV encyclopedia articles project? Do I just add my name to the list of \"This project is maintained by...\", or something else?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: ARSBot seems to not be working? Can it be turned back on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 13:\nText: Hi, what does this mean - if I am to be a named party in the case I at least need ot understand what it is about, please explain - \"\"Feuding and BLPs\" a case to examine meta behavioral issues and reconcile the applicable principles??? - what do you perceive this is related to?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Just move <url> to <url>.

Or are those box types exempt?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: The block you created on April 18th has expired and a new rash of vandalism has broken out.  Would you mind blocking this school for even longer than 1 month?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: Noetica: help! Can you give an opinion <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: I have an e-mail set up in wikipedia, but I normally keep it disabled. Are you online right now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 19:\nText: The icon is appearing before the number and after . Can you have a look ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: I am alright, though I am no <url> or Sandy. Which article is this regarding, Milner?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: Tim, it strikes me that DNA is getting more than average vandalism for daytime; I suspect it's schoolbreak week somewhere.  I'm not able to help much as it takes so long for the page to load; do you think it's time to ask for a semi-protection break?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 22:\nText: Either <url> is really misinterpreting the guidelines or I missed out on something. Care to shed light here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 23:\nText: I'll be touch and go for a few days, but hopefully I will have a stable connection again.

How do you suggest we get this project off the ground?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: I don't understand how you find it appropriate to talk about your illegal drug use on your user page.  Also, how do you have the right to ban other people's usernames with a name like \"'''BONG'''warrior\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 28:\nText: I am reluctant to mention this, but having your paragraph in bold on <url> seems to me to be a bit self-promotional and unfair to the other members. Is there any chance that I might be able to persuade you to voluntarily unbold it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: If you're interested, I could provide you with Subversion (which is superior to CVS) for VandalProof.
