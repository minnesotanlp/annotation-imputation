Is this in the right place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 2:\nText: You are talking about direktor, right? He begin the edit war again, as seen by diffs, so C was blocked instead of direktor, see?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Understood. Do you know of any legal expert you could contact to clarify this issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: I see. So what should I do with this sockpuppet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I also found your audio uploads at <url>. If it's not a burden, would you mind recording more Hungarian town names for WP?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: Very well.  What is your figure for annual worldwide hysterectomies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: And  what did I do wrong???????????????????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: What you really need to do if you want an article on 'Do Anything Nice' is to establish its notability. Can you find multiple non-trivial mentions in reliable sources that refer to it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: Well, I haven't seen a lot there, but the pages that I've seen were sourced. Does this mean you consider a sourced article in Wikipedia also unreliable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: I see that you are becoming a little bit paranoid. Do i need to do a check user for you ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 11:\nText: He's still at it, and stating that we can't stop him as he has not got a static IP.

What more information does it provide about Argos, Atlas, Julie, Ron, and the FISS Metas?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: You're acting very oddly today: You've just reverted two separate edits on <url>, saying they were the phrasing of the Lancet, but neither references the Lancet, and it seems unlikely that both would have the same statement applying to them. Have you been hacked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: Oh, yeah, I've heard of that--that was the issue the Colonel was (incorrectly) alluding to, right?  Is that list to which your link sent me something that Steve had to create, or was it generated automatically?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: I'm afraid I don't entirely understand what you mean.

Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: Also, 'topological proof'? Isn't 'proof' a bit strong?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I've also put a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag on your user page... I'm not entirely sure if that's what you were after?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: So both of us already broke 3RR.  Do you want to esclate it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: You added managerial stats but they state Ferguson only managed St.Mirren for 12 games.

Are you able to shed any light on the issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: Well, the article is sourced to his official bio site (government), whereas none of the two sources you mentioned strikes me as strong. We've got <url>, why not follow the article sources and keep George Petalotis?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: Would you be happy to accept my painting of a certain landscape then, if I was a good enough painter? My sketch of a certain bird, if I was a good enough sketcher?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 18:\nText: I'm not sure what you are asking here.

Mainly, what do I put in the box for the secondary confirmation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: I'm always happy to give a second opinion on ID - you're welcome to put images on my talk page to discuss them.
