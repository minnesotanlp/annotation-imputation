Is there a discussion ongoing that you can point to?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: I thought we had all agreed that the lead is fine as it is.  What is the sentence supposed to mean?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 3:\nText: In the article <url>, the names and details of all the recipients (both the chronological list and the alphabetical list) have now been completed. What steps should now be taken in order to reassess the article's rating on the Wikipedia Israel Project quality scale, and also to ensure that that the article is correctly referenced within the project?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: Heh, thanks. Do you know of any scripts that might come in handy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 5:\nText: A follow-up question: How far away from the true ridge does the watershed extend, using your looser definition? Is it the entire hillside entire you enter a channel?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 6:\nText: I posted here rather than to Jon's page because I don't want to embarrass the students; I know Jon watchlists your page and I am sure other NRG editors do too.  Anyway, what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 7:\nText: As I have said before, it is an issue of breadth vs. depth. Are you familiar with such concepts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 8:\nText: <person>, with whom you discussed linkspam in 2006, has returned. Could you offer your views on his talkpage?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 9:\nText: Looks like <url> (the one missing the side-chain) is unused and doesn't seem useful (due to that structural flaw). Maybe tag it for deletion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 10:\nText: Why did you just do that? I am being serious - what business was it of yours exactly?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 11:\nText: I'm familiar with <url> and I don't think it violates <url>. Which specific provision of <url> are you referring to?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 12:\nText: On reflection it's up for GA peer review, preparatory to trying for FAC. Would you care to <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 13:\nText: I'm trying to install Lupin/Anti-vandal tool, but im stuck. Could you help please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hi Dirk. Does the two books you cited for the heavy Belgian <url> losses have any info of how many Gladiators the Belgians lost, and perhaps what losses they incurred on the Germans?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 15:\nText: I'd like not to receive any notices from this bot on my talk page. Is there a way to do this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: I wonder, did anyone add new links leading to the portal?  Is there an easy way to check this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: When JaGaBot updated the monthly challenge winners on <url>, it stripped the image. Could the bot be fixed to leave the image?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 18:\nText: Actually, material in the lead must be discussed in the body. Contemporary economics haven't been discussed in the body, so how can they be discussed in the lead?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 19:\nText: The placement of the hyphen in \"Ekur-huleni\" seems odd: as far as I know \"rh\" is one sound in Tsonga. Maybe \"Eku-rhuleni\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 20:\nText: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \"naming\" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: Hi, it looks as if SVG images in taxoboxes are not counted when producing the list of tree of life articles without images. Is that intended ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: ..to Giggy's RfA. Did you mean to remove 2,066 bytes of replies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 23:\nText: I think these are reasonable, and should protect you from lawyering. Should I go ahead and add this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 24:\nText: He keeps coming back, and keeps getting blocked again.... When will they learn?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 25:\nText: What is the source of this image? and why do you think it's PD?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 26:\nText: This is helpful for automatized transfer scripts. By the way, did I get the location tag right on <url> :-) ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: Sorry, another issue has taken my attention, and I don't think I can get to this task. Since you are running AWB, and have thought through how to do the regexes, is there a reason you can't make the heading change yourself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 28:\nText: However, I will admit that there are enough hits on Google about \"Fraudulent hoax\" that we could possibly make an article out of it. Is that ok with you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: That's basically what our members have said, not necessarily my opinion. Anything I miss?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 30:\nText: Ping. Are you providing the missing sources or removing the unsourced material, so I can make it pass GA?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was \"Left-libertarianism in political philosophy\".  If it were changed back to something like that and moved to the top, would that be satisfactory?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: So argument that \"''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''\" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: No problem, done. What's your connection to Casey?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've been \"busy\" (all day today in Death Valley admiring the spring bloom), and I would like to get at least partial buyin from HG if possible. Not a big hurry to rename, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: So you are still sidestepping the question.  Please answer it directly:  please answer my question, clearly:  are you saying is that you cannot use the wiki to edit cooperatively with other people on the same text, or are you saying that you can use the wiki as it was intended and edit a single text cooperatively?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 6:\nText: I'd be glad to help, if you like. How should we divide it, by section or by criteria?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hey, what was with the fact tag? Do you dispute its name?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 8:\nText: You may need to enable your own setting to allow E-mail too; I'm not sure. If so, maybe you can turn it on temporarily, so that you can send me one e-mail?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 9:\nText: I see you have a BugZilla account. How do you make it so it doesn't show your email to everybody?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Hope that you don't mind, I modified your comment in the Craig intro, using a nice new template that I found.  Check it out: what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Hmmm, Dev, Jet123's nom doesn't really count as your second one, right? I can overwrite it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 12:\nText: I have not seen quotation sections on any other Australian politician page. Also, who chose these \"quotations?\" What qualifies as a quotation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: Thank you for the links and the explanation. I'd like to help with the project, what did you have in mind?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hmm. Over?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 15:\nText: I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the \"sh\" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 16:\nText: Thanks; I expected a decline, despite my extensive comments at <url>. As there is nothing more to this article than listings of bylines in non-notable publications, minor book acknowledgments, uncredited movie extra roles, blog comments, paid directory listings, and unsubstantiated claims about wildly over-the-top PR accomplishments, what exactly do you consider to be the examples of \"credible notability\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 17:\nText: Why nominate this for deletion? It was obviously created by someone who didn't know how to use redirects, so would it not be best to just correct it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 18:\nText: So, I'm a \"deletion fanatic\"? Why don't you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 19:\nText: That's nice. May I ask why you noticed this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 20:\nText: I was thinking more of making the line longer so that the team's name can fit on it. Is that doable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: I agree with Deb. Is there anything else you are interested in besides city planning?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: I removed that second paragraph entirely, since the information is covered in the article.  Do you feel that the lead should be larger?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 23:\nText: You had problems with both versions? Do you have cookies enabled in <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 24:\nText: Unfortunately for those who like railroads, it's been closed again! DOn't you people have better things to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 25:\nText: Thanks for your additional categorizing. :) I guess I could just look at your contributions, but before catting, what \"work\" were you doing previously?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: Meh - perhaps not, and they will most likely be closed as renames, but I figured another week to allow anyone who wants to to comment wouldn't hurt anything since you as the nominator were the only one who had commented so far. Is there something I missed, or a hurry to get these quickly renamed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: Sure thing, you've been doing great work so far. Would it help to maybe translate the whole article first as it is, and then over the course of time you can play around with the sections and add stuff that you find?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 28:\nText: Interesting; I thought I was fairly familiar with Wikipedia rules. Which rules exactly did I violate by closing an AfD (allegedly) without reading the underlying article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 29:\nText: It appears that that article was deleted because not enough info was found on the person. Doesn't the new article have enough info?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 30:\nText: Unless you provide a wikipedia article, with solid references od proof of notability of the term, I am going to delist it. I ave no doubts that there was a dilike of Portugals (like any other major nation), but was this word in notable circulation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Thanks a lot for clearing that up. Do you also happen to know about the age of consent in Thailand, and why he could be charge with child sex offenses even though she was 17 years old?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
