What's up with that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi again - it looks like the same user is editing out all the information about Destiny being self-centred again.

Is it possible that the E1 class were the rebuilds of the 118 class?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 14:\nText: Something's still not right with me here. Think you can perform one of those cleanups?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 15:\nText: Ok. Thank you for clarifying.

Do you know anything about that process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hey, doesn't look like anyone at <url> are concerned about our move proposition?

What help do you need?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 25:\nText: Despite our long-standing disagreement, I have no argument with you <url>. However, can I suggest you use a less opaque edit summary than  ''added info'' when doing something that is nonetheless controversial?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: When I look at the stats on the <url> wiki page I only see 55 Major appearances from 1972 onwards.

Hey Scientist, is that an all-time low?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: Right, I was demonstrating that one could merge <person> with <person>, that option would not appear on players that were not Dual players.

Sen?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: Is the new draft at <url> OK with you?
