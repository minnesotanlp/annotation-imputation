Example 2:
Text: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 3:
Text: Sorry to bother you but theres a report on <url> regarding <url> which has been a target for IP vandalism.

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 10:

Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 18:
Text: It's a possibility, but still leaves the problem that the terms are US Army jargon (at least, I don't recall hearing them anywhere else!). Maybe a transwiki to Wiktionary would be better?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 19:
Text: I note also that so far you seem to be the sole editor who favors deletion, while several have favored retention of the article, possibly with editing. Could it be that your view does not command consensus?

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: What a joke, this player has played league football all his career and some clown has now deleted it off, what kind of rules has this been deleted under then?
