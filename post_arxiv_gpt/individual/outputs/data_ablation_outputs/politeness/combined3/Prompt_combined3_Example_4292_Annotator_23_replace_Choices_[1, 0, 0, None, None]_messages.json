So what do you think--is there enough content in the rangefinding section to make a standalone article, and do I provide enough argument to justify pulling it out, and adding links from <url> and <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: I have unexplained pain. What do you think of this <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: I am not familiar with the credit card / porn star identity incident you mentioned in AnonEMouse's RFA, but I would like to take a closer look at it.

Would you like me to run one or both of them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 7:\nText: I have created a Neutral section for those who agree with the premise but not the method, or some other aspect, which may be altered following talkpage discussion. Perhaps you would wish to review your !vote under the changed circumstances?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: Not sure if you are saying that I am beating a dead horse in raising the inclusion criteria problem again... or if Doncram is doing so in objecting to my doing so again.  Or is it both?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 9:\nText: Hi Finell: I have filed an RfC at <url>. Could you take a look at this matter and proffer some advice?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: A question has come up whether <url> was Jewish (see <url>).  Do you have any references that might help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: Thanks for the alert.  By the way, how's Granny doing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: Concerning <url>, I must say I am a bit confused: isn't the article's title \"Austria<span style=\"color:red\">u2013</span>Hungary\" (where, incidentally, it was moved after an \"Austria<span style=\"color:red\">-</span>Hungary\" period)? It's really no big deal, but how can something be both correct and incorrect, and which standard are we at long last supposed to follow?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 13:\nText: Hi, I just had a look at the <url> article and spotted that the link <url> goes to a dab page, are any of the options there the right one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Could you please check over the article of <url>.

Would you be willing to take a look at the debate I'm having at <url> and do whatever you think is best?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 16:\nText: Hi, J.delanoy, I was just wondering why you did <url>. If in your opinion that text shouldn't be there, why not just delete it completely?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 17:\nText: In <url>, I think I screwed up and I bit the newcomer in my first post (<url>). What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: I think it is a great idea to merge my Geraldine Jones article to the flip Wilson show article, but I don't know how to do that.

I recently made some mistakes and I can understand if I am placed in some type of probation were I am monitored and forbidden to use my tools maybe for a year, but do I really merit the removal of my adminship?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 22:\nText: Hi there, it looks like the moving editor has added a bunch of references to the talk page supporting the fact Toto is no longer formally referred to as Moorland Totilas.  Do you think if we added one or more of the refs he's added on the talk page to the article we could move it back?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 23:\nText: I'm see about the new Version 0.7 - which stated should FINALLY be published soon... When the exact date it published? Is there anything that I can help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: I had no idea that I was such a rogue admin. Are you seriously suggesting that I need to be kicked off the project for closing a deletion debate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 25:\nText: Okay Murgh, I userfied only your revisions of Sore Thumbs to your user space, <url>.  Did you want the associated talk page or can I delete that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 26:\nText: Hey, i saw you added <person> some time ago to the pic page. I'm just curious, why do you want it to still be available here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 27:\nText: This Latvian Scout image has Zemgale in the name, but the Latvian name is 6000 miles away buried in storage.

Anything?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 29:\nText: Just wondering, is there any reason why you removed categories from a number of articles and replaced them with the non-existend <url>.

Or have you done some fancy trick with your signature to stop it linking back to your user page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Yobot labelled <url> as a stub, though it has <person>. Perhaps that's a dab template Yobot doesn't know about?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: The new features of Hotcat are excellent: whom do I thank for this? :-) Are you still its maintainer?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: If you are beccoming a target again do you want semi prot for a while?

Looking at your recent contributions, I see they're all marked as minor... perhaps you've inadvertantly ticked the \"Mark all edits minor by default\" check box in the Editing tab of your user preferences?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: That is actually quite a fair percentage, less than sixty six point six percent approval and the tool is not continued.

He's only done one nonsense page so far: is the name similarity enough to block as a sock?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: You won't even let the ink on your report dry and you're already at it again.

Is the flag even available on Wikipedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 16:\nText: Hi- The Magnificent Clean-keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of \"notability\" as the reason. Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of \"notability\" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 17:\nText: \"Book\" in question is A4 or thereabouts, and runs to a grand total of 32 pages including covers.

Where did you get the idea, out of curiosity?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 21:\nText: I found this talk page (and <url>) while deleting the user pages that you requested.  Would you like to have them deleted as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 22:\nText: I ran across this again this month.
