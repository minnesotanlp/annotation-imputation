Example 4:
Text: I don't recall any consensus on that unilateral change. Can you direct me to it, please?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 7:
Text: As I've only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut-and-paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly.  Was db-1 the right tag for <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 8:
Text: It would be better to have this discussion on the TKD talk page. Why don't you re-post it there?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 12:
Text: Although Singapore does not use Traditional Chinese, I still think we should at least add Traditional Chinese titles for shows not made by Mediacorp, and bought from overseas (mainly Hong Kong) TV stations. What do you think?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 13:
Text: Hi, You stated the editor is inactive, yet the editor is stalking me through MY CONTRIBUTIONS and reverting my entries and the editor left a message on the top of my TALK page, so why would you not block them ?  You didn't even give them a warning ?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Text: Howcheng, <url>u2014Great pic, but needs size, and the readers are caught between small at 550px or huge at full res. I wonder whether 600px would be possible, with a link to the interactive wideview function at the end of the blurb?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 21:
Text: <url>  Honestly, I'd like to know if you really are defending <url>.  Do you really believe that they were justified?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 22:

Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 23:
Text: ---- Though I thought I would note that you have now exceeded <big>'''500'''</big> edits while on "wikibreak" and that is over less than 10 days, May I ask what kind of break is that???

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 29:

Text: Huh? Is that a web address or a wikilink?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 10:
Text: Yes, I'd seen your note, but it looks as though all five of those edits were made by users other than Terra. Do you have any reason to suspect they are his sockpuppets?

Annotation from annotator: 2

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 22:
Text: I'd be more than happy to :) It may take a while as I've got other stuff on, but as long as you're in no immediate hurry all should be well. Do you have any preferences/requirements for the end result?
Annotation from annotator: 20
