Is <url> more relevant to explain the analogy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 2:\nText: Ah, so next time I don't have to include \"Places\". Are there more specific categories I could use instead of \"Places\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 3:\nText: I'm not sure what you are asking here. Admins cannot check IPs but why would you even want the same IP that would be foolish wouldn't it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: Ha, you're too kind to me, my old friend. MK one day, promise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 5:\nText: We need a visual of some kind. How's the state of your right-brain today?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 6:\nText: The Indian collaboration of the week will be the <url> next week. Would you be interested in joining us to make it a Featured Article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 7:\nText: I don't follow.  Can you address the above with regard to why it ''shouldn't'' be speedily deleted, as a recreation of deleted material, and as a content fork?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: This is what you wrote: \"In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times.\" What book, 1948??\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: It was for closure's sake, as to show that the debate was closed and that was the result, the user was '''blocked''' and the userpage was '''deleted'''.  Doesn't that show you the items better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: Thank You. What is \"The Prince of Santorini\" anyway?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 11:\nText: While you are absolutely free to vote however you choose, FAC requires you lodge actionable objections and your objection as it stands right now is quite vague. Could you please specify it so I can take action and possibly reverse your vote?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 12:\nText: Not trying to pick a fight - a user that reverts all articles to a version by you is suspect. Any New Year's resolutions Will?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: I note you also removed the statement that \"Hurrell had been involved in previous altercations\". Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: I am willing to try to discover the problem. What browser do you use?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: The answer is \"one citation per city\". Information must always be verifiable; without verifiable sources for say, Unna, how exactly are we to tell that the article is accurate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 16:\nText: Those of us who've been here the whole time are pretty incredulous about it also. :)  We miss your fine editing style and hope you come back sometime -- keep looking in on us now and then, at least?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 17:\nText: Could you take a look at the article now and see whether your concerns (except the reorganization) have been addressed? If not, what is still missing, and what technical terms do you feel need explaining?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Well this seems odd to me. Don't you find it strange that otherwise authoritative sources like Emulex and IBM would be so full of mistakes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 19:\nText: TimPF - I don't see the objectives as mutually exclusive, the previous creation of the Suburban Rail stubs by others took the content in a direction which I am reinforcing with these edits which fill out the stubs and bring a bit of consistency within the Suburban parts of RTIL.  PRTIL could fulfill a similar function for mainline services perhaps?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 20:\nText: I'm glad you made things calculate automatically (and I trust you've tested it!). Shouldn't we update the <url> to not show the unneeded variables, then?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: Alright, I added my final ideas. <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: The \"standard work\" on Introduction to... articles is presently <url>, maybe you could add your thoughts as some kind of appendix/discussion? I don't know what the procedure is for essays, single author of Wiki-style?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: I have it ready now. Would there be any policy violations if I upload the image over the protected one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: What would be needed is for a human to check the list, do various filters, and then suggest values for the missing data. What is the best format to return the data in, having in mind the idea to get a bot to add the data?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 25:\nText: OK, I'll bite. How is ''Matt \"Dirty\" Sanchez'' to be construed as anything other than a personal attack?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 26:\nText: <url> and <url>, both created  by you, seem to be mostly overlapping but are not identical.  Presumably one should be a redir to the other?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 27:\nText: I remember your commenting on this about seven years ago.  What's your view today?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 28:\nText: Also, how does that vandalism thing on your page work? Do you have to change the count manually, or does it detect vandalism itself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 29:\nText: Thanks for adding stuff to the update. Would you like to help out with the notifications (the real pain of this ... grrr)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 30:\nText: Sorry... haven't unblocked many people before. Is it ok now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: The <url> has a request (header \"<url>\") left a few hours ago by someone who has pictures of signs in China but can't read them.  Would you please be willing to help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: May I say it this way: ''Even if the car always is known to be behind the same door,'' but if you make your decision \"at random\", ''even then'' your chance is 2/3 to have picked a goat. Okay?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 3:\nText: Well, actually I wanted to know if there were any errors in my own maps. ;)  Anyway, is the new map at <url> better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: Understood. Do you know of any legal expert you could contact to clarify this issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Well, I haven't seen a lot there, but the pages that I've seen were sourced. Does this mean you consider a sourced article in Wikipedia also unreliable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: E-mail me at <url> (just get rid of the spaces in between the letters and numbers) whenever you feel like it. By the way are you a member on any Iranian football forums online?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 7:\nText: Also, 'topological proof'? Isn't 'proof' a bit strong?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 8:\nText: Lists like this are a bad idea to begin with, and this one in particular has been deleted via an AfD. Why not try categories instead?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 9:\nText: I noticed that the A team article for Australia is at <url> instead of <url>.  Is that intentional, or something we should fix with a page move?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 10:\nText: You're welcome to revert edits, but I'm puzzled as to why you reverted this one - it seems absolutely essential to me the give a summary of Genesis 1. And if you revert Gen1, why leave Gen2?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 11:\nText: I have indicated on <url> that, should you be desyopped, I will immediately re-nominate you for sysop.  Would you accept the nomination if I did?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: Well... actually it is <nowiki><!--commented--></nowiki>. Could it be visible?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 13:\nText: <person>, with whom you discussed linkspam in 2006, has returned. Could you offer your views on his talkpage?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: User 86.138.232.97 does have a history of malicous edits. Are you then confirming that these malicious edits done by user 86.138.232.97 were done by yourself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 15:\nText: My concern about the article above still stands (re: notability). Now that it has been unmerged (against the AfD), will it be merged into the Begin articles as suggested, or will it have to be renominated?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 16:\nText: I'm a little surprised you haven't responded to my suggestions regarding the GAN yet. Is there some sort of a problem there, or have you just not managed to get around to it yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 17:\nText: I'm sure that this is not a useful place to discuss the merits of your topic ban, which I think would need a wider audience to overturn. Perhaps you could make a request to the arbitration committee?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: I personally cannot see why it is justified, well not from a quick perusal of his edit history anyway. Can you explain please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 19:\nText: I vote that they stay, given that even though they're not \"Recurring\" in and of themselves, they're part of a recurring phenomenon, which is Stephen doing \"Better Know a District\" spin-offs. So, maybe we should re-group them under a heading of \"Spin-Offs\" in the \"BKaD\" section?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 20:\nText: I'm always happy to give a second opinion on ID - you're welcome to put images on my talk page to discuss them. Regarding <url>, I would tend to go with ''<url>'', what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: Actually, I am concerned that you had completely removed verifiable facts of which I had included the references.  Would you please explain why you had removed the entire section I wrote on Collection Agencies in Canada?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 22:\nText: Hi Kathleen - It looks OK to me; all I did was change the template wording a bit and add parent cats to the stub category. What problem were you having?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 23:\nText: Please stop removing properly referenced information that I have added to this article.  This is an article that <b>YOU</b> nominated for deletion, so why are you even editing it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 24:\nText: Which of course is all the more ironic as my initial edits were an attempt to ''improve'' the article per <url>. Who the hell would have predicted all this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 25:\nText: Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I'm having a bad night, and all the theading... anyway, did I get them all?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: Hm. Are you asking to be banned?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 27:\nText: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 28:\nText: I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 29:\nText: Hey. I'm proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 30:\nText: BTW, I'm amazed that he has the gumption to show his mug after <url>. And do you have the balls (metaphorically or otherwise) to place a hatnote above his article linking to that term?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Hi, do you mind if I move your hook to go live on 26/27th? The GLAM WIKI conference could do with being highlighed by a non US/UK hook?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
