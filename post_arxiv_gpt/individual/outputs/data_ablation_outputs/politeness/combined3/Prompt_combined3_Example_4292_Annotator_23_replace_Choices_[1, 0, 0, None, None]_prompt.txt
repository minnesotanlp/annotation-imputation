Example 2:
Text: I just occurred to me yesterday (while playing with the Bushnell 7x50 Marine binocs I got for my birthday), that the <url> section on rangefinding reticles might be worth its own article, if for no other reason than that rangefinding reticles are used on other optics, such as said binoculars (which have a compass and 5 milliradian graduated reticle) and some other specialized items, such as golf rangefinding monoculars, which use the standardized height of the flag as the known size item.  So what do you think--is there enough content in the rangefinding section to make a standalone article, and do I provide enough argument to justify pulling it out, and adding links from <url> and <url>?

It's really no big deal, but how can something be both correct and incorrect, and which standard are we at long last supposed to follow?
