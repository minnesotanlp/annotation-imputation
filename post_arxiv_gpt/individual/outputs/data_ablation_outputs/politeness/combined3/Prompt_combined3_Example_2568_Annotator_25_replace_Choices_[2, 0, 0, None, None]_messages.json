Since when does any one editor have to understand all the material of a subject known by the other editors?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: I noticed a recent edit and upload of yours and have reverted your edit and started a discussion thread <url>. Would you be able to comment there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Thanks for that - very nicely commented code (rare to see)! It seems to need a table to be set up - do you have the schema or sql for that handy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: You are able to read it here <url>. Wondering if this is worthy of sign post?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: We have an ongoing problem with this article, it is stated that he is \"Irish born British\", where in reality he was Irish, even though the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland existed back then, it is not a reason. Could you help resolve the issue one way or another?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: As I've only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut-and-paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly.  Was db-1 the right tag for <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hi, I was removed from the \"request for approval\" list at the vandalproof, and not put on either the \"approved\" or \"denied\" lists. Could you tell me why, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hi Cmadler, I've written a new ALT hook at the <person> that I think addresses your concerns.  Could you sign off on the nomination?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: Is it possible to revert more than one revision at a time? Or must you be an administrator to do that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Sure. Aside from the Flea and Frusciante articles, which get the most traffic?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: A question has come up whether <url> was Jewish (see <url>).  Do you have any references that might help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: Did you see the edit by Marrtel - <url> - to <url> ? Is that a reasonable change ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 13:\nText: Hi again!  Per your <url>, I'll leave questions here, which actually leads me to a question, hehe;  why would you want users to bring RfA discussion to your talk page rather than keeping it in a centralised viewable location on the RfA page where users are encouraged to submit questions for optional response by the candidate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 14:\nText: <url>. Or is it just me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: Would you be okay if I seconded your nomination? Or would you prefer me to add as a \"support\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: You see, I expended quite some time on this, referenced it thoroughly, and thereby resolved a confusion between the medieval <url> and the text by Origen.

Do you know where the info comes about <url> concerning <url> and the other town?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: I'm not trying to be obtuse, but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn't apply because the assertion of notability has been made?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: I found that you have participated in the last <url> concerning the use of flag icons, but I wonder why it appears that the talk reached to an end without a real guideline or consensus.

Are you on facebook?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: The policy is tricky - I guess it comes down to whether or not you think the account is going to be disruptive, and whether it is appropriate to guess that ahead of time.  On the other hand, looks like another overreaction to Kurt, in my opinion - what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: Have you been able to find anything confirming that last result yet?

Can you add the URL, publication date, and access date?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: <url> seems does not exist.
