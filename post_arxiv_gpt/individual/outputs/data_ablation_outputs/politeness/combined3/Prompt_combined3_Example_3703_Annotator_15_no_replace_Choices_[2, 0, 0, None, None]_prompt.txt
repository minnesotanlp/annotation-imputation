Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 13:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 14:
Text: Good day, sorry to bother you. Is the 2:00 am news brief called eyewitness news everynite, and if it is do they play move closer to your world?

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 16:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 17:
Text: I began to make an article for <url> but found that one already existed but was deleted. After reading the deletion log and seeing that it was speedy deleted for a7, I think I can write an article that establishes notability, but am I required to get administration approval before recreating a deleted article or can I just create it on my own?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 23:
Text: Then why is the article for the monastery in Lhasa as "Ganden" instead of "Gandan"? Do both the monasteries have the same name?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 24:
Text: Well, I think this is a murder that could do with wide categorisation (as an example of asian-on-white killings, rather than the far more famous white-on-black, not to mention that British does nto automatically=English. If it's merely a matter of preference, do you mind if I put the British one back?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 25:
Text: I agree with Orlady here; full-protection, a fairly serious position when we're talking about an encyclopedia anyone can edit, is only to be taken out as a last (reasonable) resort. Since both participants to the dispute are now blocked, is there any reason for the protection to be necessary?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 26:
Text: Having said that, I don't want to drive anyone away just because they can't write well. The question is, where do you begin?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 28:
Text: I'm with you - it really is a friggin' pain that people refuse to read no matter how big you put the text.  Should we just maybe remove the source entirely?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 29:
Text: I thought you had done that, and started working on turning it into a disambiguation page.  Could you now graft the history on to the changes I made?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 3:
Text: In retrospect "in as far away as" looks ungrammatical. Shouldn't it just be "as far away as"?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 4:
Text: Hey, so your move of this, and wanted to point out that the reason I put a disambig title on it, was because there are two different labor unions of the same name, either one of which could wind up with an article. But, I don't know that that means the article should automatically get the title, is there a standard for this situation?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 5:
Text: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 9:
Text: I thought that only section tags go into sections while the article tags go to the top of the page so they could serve it's purpose. Is there a Wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 10:
Text: Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Text: In the article on <url>, you recently replaced a non-free image with J. Malcolm Greany's ''Ansel Adams and Camera'' on the basis that the latter image is in the public domain. How did you determine that this image is a work of the U.S. government?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 17:
Text: Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don't (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 18:
Text: I'm confused: what did you do?  And how did you delete it twice without restoring it in between?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 19:
Text: Thanks, the logo looks much better now. You wouldn't have a logo for the two predessesor clubs by any chance?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 20:
Text: Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 21:
Text: I noticed that you changed the formatting for <url> slightly, putting the links to 18-crown-6 and en to the sentence after the chemical structure rather than in the chemical structure itself. Why is that?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 22:
Text: After <url> <url>, all/most of the needs specified have been completed. Do you think its worth re-nominating <url> for FA or GA status?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 27:
Text: You deleted Ricardo Marinello. What was written in the article?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 28:
Text: ''You wrote:'' I'm not trying to be obtuse, but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn't apply because the assertion of notability has been made?

Example 29:
Text: Jvhertum, Last year you made this change :http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Split-Second&action=historysubmit&diff=343316267&oldid=343252107 to the <url> article with the justification that "A is part of the name". This does not appear to be a valid reason to exclude it (<url> has a DEFAULTSORT of Beatles despite 'The' being part of the name), your thoughts ?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 30:
Text: There are a few posts at <url> saying people are having trouble seeing the DYK picture that's up now. Do you think you could switch it?
