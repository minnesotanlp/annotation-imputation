Suggestions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Why do you have this user name??\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 4:\nText: I don't know what page you are talking about, as this is your only edit. Did you perhaps have another account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 5:\nText: <url> needs urdu script for the name of the subject (Bangla script has already been added). Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 6:\nText: From the edit history to the template, it appears that your last edit has not been undone so hopefully this issue is resolved. You are both editors of between 1 and 2 years experience here, so perhaps a bit better communications would be a better approach in future?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 7:\nText: Remember we had the whole edit warring on Edelsten article a while back? I find it curious that a recently created account posted this <url> as their first contribution basically supporting Edelsten's personal website (which when you look would hardly pass <url>, I looked it at this site a while back in research and found some of the positive claims could not be verified) and wanting a complete rewrite of the article... sound familiar?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 8:\nText: Well, don't everyone talk all at once now. :) Any suggestions for the article ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 9:\nText: In fact, I think I remember saying something to that effect during the ArbCom election campaign.

What's the deal?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 12:\nText: <url> is a bit of a stretch. Do you think you might strike it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 13:\nText: I am happy to rewrite it but please explain to me how it is any different from the Warrior Lacrosse and STX pages? They don't have any links except to their own websites?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 14:\nText: Sovereignty is something a thing, in this case Japan, possesses, hence the apostrophe. So what's the problem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 15:\nText: Regarding your time setting, I'm a little unsure what you want to do - there are only two things you can change - the timezone offset from GMT, which you set at the bottom of the screen by selecting the correct offset for your location from the list - I'm guessing Asia/Calcutta would be about right, and the way the date/time is displayed, which you choose from the list of five options at the top of the screen. What problems are you having ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 16:\nText: Do your hardback copies of <url> have a dust jacket (mine doesn't).

I wonder if this is the first time someone's beat me to it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 19:\nText: That's fine. Question: how did you find that out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: Rxe9nyi leaves out the other gruesome details and adds the context of the fortress.  Do you know which details are in the most widespread and/or original version of this tale?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: <url> is having <url> spelling \"<url>\".  Perhaps you could help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 22:\nText: I was just now leaving a note on Ruhrfisch's talk page, and noticed that you'd left a note there.

Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Do you still take photos in Jefferson Parish?
