Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 6:
Text: I'm sorry, but there is no discussion on the talk page that indicates that there was a debate about renaming, so the keep vote stands, I'm afraid.  There were nine votes to keep, and only one to merge, so I don't understand how a single vote trumps nine others?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 7:
Text: I created the redirect page "SEAC (computer)" and I think the article chould go there, with redirects from the other two names.  Since you are an administrator, can you do that?

Text: That sounds like they are just "general use" of the word, so in each article delink and (if needed) explain that, in this context, diaphragm means a divider - or just rewrite without the word diaphragm, or use a link to wiktionary. In fact, should linking to wiktionary be a standard way to clear up some of the links to dab pages?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 17:

Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 19:
Text: I have addressed many of the points that you had brought up at the FAC, as well as many of the comments from other editors, some of whom have changed their sentiment recently to "Support".

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 27:
Text: As a rough look over, the splits look ok to me (although yes, more discussion before forking is generally a good thing). If you think there are serious problems with them, why not just address it on the talk page?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 28:
Text: I've had a look at it...I cannot make the height/width of the image any smaller because it will limit the number of towns I can add.  Therefore, is there any point to adding an atlas to wikipedia?

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 3:
Text: I think it is important to note that Spirit 03 was the last gunship to be brought down and that it has not been involved in a Class A mishap since that date. Should we include that?

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 12:
Text: You make it very hard to believe that you're acting in good faith when you rewrite the <url> article to remove all references to "liberal," but keep the phrase "conservative Independence Institute."  I see POV-pushing when that happens.  If you're so concerned about adjectives, why not edit the articles about AEI or Heritage or Americans for Tax Reform?
