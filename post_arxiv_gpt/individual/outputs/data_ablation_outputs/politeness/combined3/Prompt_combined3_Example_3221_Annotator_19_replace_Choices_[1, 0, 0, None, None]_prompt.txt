You were the only editor to object to this going ahead, with this comment: "So, suggest keep this on hold for now, but in principle one might similarly split off other classification categories with this then just umbrella simple introduction." Do you still hold this view?

Any further thought?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 20:
