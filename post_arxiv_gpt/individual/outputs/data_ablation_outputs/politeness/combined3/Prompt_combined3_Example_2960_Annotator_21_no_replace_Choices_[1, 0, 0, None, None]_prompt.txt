Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 18:
Text: Can I also point out that the text that you pasted into Wikipedia is entirely inappropriate for an encyclopedia article and at best will require extensive editing to conform to the<url>. Are you going to do that editing, or are you going to leave it to one of the other 'lazy' people who edit this encyclopedia?
Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 19:

Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 23:

Text: Your reasoning is very sound, it would appear that USGS is wrong and I have no problem with changing it back.  In general, what are your thoughts on using the GNIS database for park coordinates/elevations as we convert to the Geobox?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 25:
Text: <url> and <url> are both accounts which have vandalised the article, and both have been created solely for vandalism. I believe they're one and the same; do you know an admin that can take action?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 26:
Text: Well, the article is sourced to his official bio site (government), whereas none of the two sources you mentioned strikes me as strong. We've got <url>, why not follow the article sources and keep George Petalotis?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 27:
Text: Sure. Aside from the Flea and Frusciante articles, which get the most traffic?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 28:
Text: He used it to assert that '''''others''''' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 29:
Text: There may not be a lot of situations like this, but there will definitely be some. I was wondering if there is any kind of invisible comment that can be added to the article in these situations so that the report doesn't include it, or if you have any other thoughts about how it might be possible to handle this situation?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Text: Yeah, I agree. What's up with that?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 2:
Text: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Text: Maybe there is a cellar to the mill, which would count towards the five. Can you get a photo or two and add to Commons?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 4:

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: OK done. When do I get my money?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Annotation from annotator: 14

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 9:
Text: I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 10:
Text: lol, turns out the photo isn't his either. Any ideas from here?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 11:

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 12:
Text: At the top of my talk page, it says, "If I left you a message: please answer on your talk page, as I am watching it."  I think I already explained this to you.  Is there a reason we cannot communicate?

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 15:

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 16:
Text: I see you've added <url> to the category "Jewish-Canadians".  What is your source for this?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:
Text: Some of his categories seem rather POV to me, and it's rather obvious from his AfD participation that there's a disruptive streak afoot. Since you've got a bit of knowledge in the area, do they seem like the kinds of things which should be deleted?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 18:
Text: Thanks very much indeed! :-) I don't suppose you'd fancy having a deadlink trawl over at <url>, would you?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 20:
Text: That's fine. Question: how did you find that out?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 21:
Text: On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to do that <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 23:
Text: Well, that was an example as I am adding Infobox Historical American Political Party infobox to all those historical parties in <url> for which I was previously using the regular Infobox American Political Party until I found the Historical version in <url>.  So if I wish to continue, I will have to assign colors and shortname to all of them if not already done (like Anti-Masonic Party) right?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 24:
Text: No problem. Have you seen the <url> article?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 25:
Text: I'm not sure I understand what this has to do with what I said.  Could you restate?
