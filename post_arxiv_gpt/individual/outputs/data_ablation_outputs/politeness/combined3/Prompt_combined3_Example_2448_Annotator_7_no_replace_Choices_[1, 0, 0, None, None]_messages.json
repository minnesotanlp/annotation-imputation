I left Billboard Hot 100 as Billboard Hot 100 because that's the exact name of the chart?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 3:\nText: I'm linking this to Fumiyo's. Are <url> and <url> among the bullies too?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: Maybe the area that is now the Chakma Autonomous District Council was (or is?) located within the Lawngtali district?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 5:\nText: Great work you've been doing on this. Would you agree with me that International Political Economy should be capitalised?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: Vaguely connected, because I don't feel like starting a new section. Have you seen <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 7:\nText: You added partisan colours for the early Chancellors (such as a conservative blue colour for Bismarck); as the early Chancellors were not attached to any political party, and the \"party\" given is merely an approximate indication of their political leanings, I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Also, why did you remove the partisan colour from the last part of the table (the Republic)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 8:\nText: I saw you removed the copyright CSD from Universum University as being \"unclear copyright status\".  What am I missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thank you so much! I hope it's allright if I move it to my front page, at least when the talk has to be archived?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 10:\nText: I am the third party; <url> was the first to dispute its use.  Why can't you describe the changes in words?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 11:\nText: Um, I'll check it out, 141.158.210.110, but I haven't had a lot of edits (if any) on that article. In the mean time, why not <url> and join the Wikipedia community?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: I think it is a great idea to merge my Geraldine Jones article to the flip Wilson show article, but I don't know how to do that. Can you help me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 13:\nText: Thanks for approving my request. Should I remove my request?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 14:\nText: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \"naming\" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: Your \"resolution\" was to move it back to \"Detective Terry Crowley\" again? Why do you keep doing that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 16:\nText: I guess there's a connection to <url> too. Do you think that's cu worthy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 17:\nText: Can you check if there was ever an article for \"Kenneth Eng\"? It seems to have been deleted, if so could you supply me with an archive of the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 18:\nText: And I'm asking for YOUR help, DrachenFyre, to control this vandal <url>'s changes to <url> and <url>.  What do we do with this nut?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 19:\nText: See my comment on the talk page. How did this ever get to DYK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 20:\nText: Hi Bruce, I normally make only trivial changes, but I've just found it necessary to do two hook rewrites. Could you check, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: Hi, although I agree with you, please check the following <url> in process. Why can't the darn thing work, in the first place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 22:\nText: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 23:\nText: What do you think? Is there a mistake somewhere?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 24:\nText: Why did you remove those German emigrant cases. Shouldn't we include those cases of people who was born in what was then Germany at the time?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 25:\nText: Okay, I've read through it, and I'm willing to accept that it's your granddaughter. Shall I delete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: Quite. Do you know why, though?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 27:\nText: It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided.  Do you have any references you can add to the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 28:\nText: Thank you for getting to all those WikiProject Canada assessements so quickly! Question, is it ''useful'' what I'm doing, adding the template even to what I know will be relative low importance articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 29:\nText: This is what you wrote: \"In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times.\" What book, 1948??\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 30:\nText: By the way. Can you edit your own talk page when it is protected?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: If you were falsely accused of vandalism, the best thing to do is to talk to the user who accused you, and explain why your edit was not vandalism. Which user accused you vandalism?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 2:\nText: But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''<url>'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 3:\nText: When we have a GLAM barnstar then you get it ..... just for the Hindi article! I cannot explain why you needed to create a Derby page in Hindi - surely it should be there already?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 4:\nText: Actually, that's again a misromanization.  Would you ''please'' stop this insanity?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 5:\nText: I was going to create the list of tallest buildings in Hartford, when I saw that it had been deleted three years ago by you. I don't understand the reason for deletion; can you clarify why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 6:\nText: Lol, yes, simply! I would have no objection to something like this \"According to \".... Records\" the song was sent to mainstream radio as the official third single in may.\" OR something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: I'm an admin, I'd be happy to do it. You want me to do it now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 8:\nText: I think that's a good solution.  Should we give it a try?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 9:\nText: If she's been in a lot of porn movies, doesn't that show she is famous. Can't you undelete it and then let it go to a AfD discussion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 10:\nText: I think a separate security section heading is required in <url> article as it gets prime billing in the introduction, but then has references (and criticisms) scattered throughout the rest of the article.  Do you support this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: See <url>. I've made them, can you help fill them out and place them in the articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: Ok.  By the way, may I note that is an excellent resource you have there.   I noticed the other day that we had acquired a list at <url> of unproduced scripts/stories - it seems entirely genuine and fits with material I have read elsewhere but was uncited - I wonder if you could help find a source for it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: I don't think I've used it in Wikipedia.  So, if I haven't, why did you bring it up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: Which seems to be exactly in line with my point about album covers. If you were referring only to logos, could you please qualify why they should be treated differently?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 15:\nText: Checkuser shows the three users share an ip from time to time. How serious is the problem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 16:\nText: Sorry??? Which comment are you referring to?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 17:\nText: Thank you for your comments. May I refer you to <url>, where I think you will find the sort of criticism section that you are looking for?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 18:\nText: Wait, what's the COI? Was this on the fringe noticeboards?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 19:\nText: Somewhat related, shouldn't <url>, be renamed to <url>? I realize that Baha'i forbids sectarianism, but this is what the article is about, no?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: Ah, I was confused by the fact that your tag was placed on <url>, not on <url>.  Wildbot has visited, & updated the talk page again, so where is the result of the whole exercise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 21:\nText: I see you've added <url> to the category \"Jewish-Canadians\".  What is your source for this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: Thanks, I didn't notice the earlier discussion. Would you consider (if you haven't done so yet) adding some indication on either page that these are the same user?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: I'm going to try and hurry the <url> article through both GA and FA to see if I can get it as the Featured Article on the Main Page in time for its 20-year anniversary on October 18, 2009. Care to help a little or a lot?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 24:\nText: I don't understand. So then you decide by yourself, and the people who stated their support for the original are ignored?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 25:\nText: My post above was a helpful hint about following DYK as a whole, not about the nomination process. Would you mind posting your post under a new heading, as it seems to have little to do with what I was saying and seems to be changing the subject?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 26:\nText: There hasn't been much progress made in the last three days. Is anyone interested in responding?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: Already past my two \"spelling correction\" edits ;) (though they are obsessed with defense). I noticed one of them changed a quoted spelling: ''acknowledgment'' to ''acknowledgement'', did you get that one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 28:\nText: Make that \"copyvio tag\". OK if I revert under those conditions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 29:\nText: Hi Thunderbrand, thanks for letting me know that the image I uploaded is on IFD. Can I ask though, why is the image being deleted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: The Italian and English rules are different from the Spanish. But if you think about it, would it make sense to list every reserve player who makes a first team appearance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nTarget Example:\nText: You didn't answer about the status of above mentioned image. Are you going to tag that image too?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
