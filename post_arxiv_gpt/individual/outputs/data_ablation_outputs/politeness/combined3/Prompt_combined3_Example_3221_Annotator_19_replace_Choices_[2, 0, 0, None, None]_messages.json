How do you convert your commutative diagrams from LaTeX to PNG?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 2:\nText: When you deleted <url> did you accidentally overlook the <person> template? Or do you have some reason for ignoring it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 3:\nText: The problem remains that I don't know where to turn to educate myself further on the matter. For instance, where would I find the Tao-Green paper you mention in the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: Thread about him on Pie & Bovril again, along with the idiocy that accompanies such. I see you semiprotected this before: fancy doing it again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 5:\nText: Do you by any chance happen to have the old legs (such as in the figures shown <url>) that go with the old armless torso?

Hector again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: I wonder if it would ever be worth doing an article on G&S scholarship?

If so, would you add the relevant flag?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: There's a nice section on funerals <url> but I'm not given a look at the contributors' page (p. 673) to see who J.B. is.

Not complaining, but why did you remove the category \"high schools in california\" from this article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 12:\nText: I noticed you've been adding the template <person> to pages - I'm sure there's a good reason but I'm totally puzzled as to why.

Can you tell me where you found it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 17:\nText: I assume the citation you added recently to <url> was from a website. Can you add the URL, publication date, and access date?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 18:\nText: I removed most of the boldface lettering from the article. And what do you mean by \"the referencing is insuficcient\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 19:\nText: Thank you for removing the \"Speedy Deletion\" from my post. I realise that I still need to do more work on the post itself, but are the sources that I am using acceptable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 20:\nText: <url> wasn't me. Could you possibly go back and correct the AN/I thread?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: I see that KarBot is editing User Talk Pages.

Any comments?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 25:\nText: <url> posted a wonderful grammatical analysis of the \"has/had\" thing, another editor agreed, so I'm thinking we should make another request for the change, using Bluewave's post as the basis.  What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 26:\nText: Another thing, I been working on trying to improve the SVG graphics at the Commons. Except for the white color background, does everything else at <url> look decent?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: I am stuck with the formatting of <url>, especially the ref tags.

Do you think that's cu worthy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: I have listened to the beginning for your recording of Thomas Jefferson and nothing is mentioned that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves or Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 4:\nText: #I am still convinced the long page on \"prostatitis\" (a misnomer in the case of CPPS) is confusing, with too many sections and subsections, and would benefit from restructuring and the creation of separate pages for each area, or at the very least the removal of the CPPS section to its own, in depth page.

Can we do something about this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: Come on Mohrflies, I donxb4t understand why you insist in these edits: <url>? Why \"Yugoslav\" when absolutely no one uses it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 2\n\nExample 11:\nText: Thanks for adding the WSL windmill picture.

Any further thought?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: Converting <url> to a redirect without preserving either the information or sources, & without discussion was ill-advised.

I have not had luck finding a free one, perhaps you can do better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Huaiwei,  there is this guy HkCaGu who insist that we shouldnt put Tianjin as one of Xiamen Airline's destination from Singapore just because it passes by Xiamen(MF's HUB) however, this is a direct flight from singapore to tianjin via xiamen. what are your views?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
