Would you like to be a mod?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Yellowmonkey has told me we need another FAR delegate and recommended you for the job.

Perhaps perform a move to Turbinella (gastropod) ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 17:\nText: I didn't have those in <person> because they were already included under the tributaries categories.

Should they be changed too or was that what they used to be called?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 26:\nText: Yes I can. Is it an alternate account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: Why are capital letters used in the article title ''<url>''? Is this a proper name of a particular proprietary software package?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: Incidentally, your username seems familiar. Do you contribute to SPGB-related forums by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 29:\nText: I was aware of that part of <url>, but I don't see its relevance here.

Can you add the URL, publication date, and access date?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: <url> seems does not exist.
