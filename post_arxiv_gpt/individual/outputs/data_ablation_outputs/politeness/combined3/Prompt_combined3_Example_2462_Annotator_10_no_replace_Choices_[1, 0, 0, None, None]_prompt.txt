Isn't that what the "Nominations 7 days or older - Decision Time" section is for?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 11:

Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 12:

Annotation from annotator: 18

Annotation from annotator: 7

Text: Hiya FFM, I want to update the <url> page to make it a proper article and perhaps get it to FA status; I know it's unusual to be part of one's own organization editing, but it is possible -- if we work on a draft in userspace and have friends/colleagues helping update the article proper.  Are you interested in working on this in the coming week or so?

Annotation from annotator: 11

Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 26:
Text: Can I ask why you deleted this AfD as "A3: Article has no meaningful, substantive content"?  It obviously did have meaningful content; was there any reason it couldn't simply be closed like any other AfD?

Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 22:
Text: Hi, that "Multics Virtual Memory: Concepts and Design" paper is already in the list of Multics papers (in the "Further Reading - Technical Details) - it even has the same URL! It only lists one source, though - perhaps the second could be added as an "(also here)" link?

Annotation from annotator: 0

Example 24:
Text: I've deleted the diagram from the <url> article because, as Curtis Clark points out in <url>, the diagram does not represent the results of the reference it purports to represent.

Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 25:
Text: You may want to take a look at <url>.  Can you be specific on what "spamming" is in this context?

For now, Celine's infobox says "CBS Records Canada (1986u20131990)", but since her discography owner/copyright holder is still Sony Canada, should I change this to Sony Music Canada (1986-present)?
Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 27:
Text: Josiah, believe me, I understand how you feel, and unless you really feel like it, I don't think you should involve yourself in the dispute, because it seems intractable. My question is more a procedural one: if an RfC doesn't generate consensus, and an edit war continues, what's the next step?
Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 28:
Text: About the arrow pawn: it moves one square per turn (if it's not Persson's variant), right? When it moves two squares in the Persson variant, can it jump?
