Be educated and please respond: What does <url> has  to do with <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 4:\nText: Why would you doubt that.

Could I cite the modules for this information?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: So I think it's better research one by one and decide which one is common name (use). What is your opinion ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: I disagree with your edit of the 21st of November.

What do you think should be done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: Can you help patroling <url> page???\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: Lists like this are a bad idea to begin with, and this one in particular has been deleted via an AfD. Why not try categories instead?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: Thank you for deleting the attack page I tagged.  Should <url> be blocked for creating it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 14:\nText: I restored the lead picture series I like. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: I am stuck with the formatting of <url>, especially the ref tags.

Would you mind unprotecting my user/talkpages please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 22:\nText: I do not, nor have I ever used other accounts on Wikipedia. Didn't you ask me this before?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 23:\nText: <url> has lots of problems, not the least of which is a misspelled title. Do you recommend it be nominated for WP:PROD, or is there a better path to take?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: Hi, thanks for unprotecting the <url> article.

Do you think <url> article is of a quality to maybe nominate it for GA yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: Thanks!

Regarding <url>, could you tell me what supports this being a free image?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: The text of your warning <url> made me smile.

But I'm just curious - why was the link to the article for \"Advent of Divine Justice\" deleted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: Well, I bet you got that from stalking me. Are you making a template I can use?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 11:\nText: I've wikified this and added some categories. Any idea of his dates, and is he still alive?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: Thanks again.  Do you have any suggestions for how we might change the article to take the practical side of this into account with being (a) inaccurate or (b) overly technical?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 13:\nText: Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: I was told by a wikipedian that these following three sources are unreliable <url>. Is that true?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: Please see <url>. Could you help with the list on the talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: Oh, Thanks. So I just need to put what articles I am going to be working on, and the coordinators will put my points on the scoreboard?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information. Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Your early edit's clearly indicate that you were not a newbie. How do explain this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 19:\nText: I am planning on changing the <url> to the ICF Flatwater World Championships. Any objections?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 20:\nText: In any case <url> should have just been me saying \"hey, could use some help\" and maybe one or two short replies of \"sounds good, I'll help\" or \"make sure you do XYZ\", but instead TT2011 again tried to turn it into another discussion. Can we collapse it to save bulk?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: Im interested in where you got the information you added stating woodlands house was closed in 2003. As far as i can see your wording was taken from one website, the milesfaster one. Should you not cite the website you quoted rather than look for a couple of others?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 22:\nText: Thank you much! May I call upon you if I make mistakes or need help, then, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 23:\nText: Thanks for the good advice.  I still think the electric-shock-button idea is a good one though :-)  You been having problems with images as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: I was discussing this with Ling.Nut, since I've seen them around before.  What do you think of a founding member userbox for yourself, me and Ling?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: Alright then!?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 26:\nText: Excellent, thanks!

If so, then shouldn't it be in the category?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: No, I have not read it, as it is of no interest to me or this encyclopedia. Are you claiming that the references make the blog post a reliable source, or why are we still discussing this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 29:\nText: <url>.. it doesn't really explain what the issue was. Can you word it better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 30:\nText: I'm interested in why you reduced the columns from 5 to 2? Could you reply on my talk page please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Hey, I found <url> and at around 1:10, I think I can see the Backstreet Boys holding platinum discs (or double platinum, I'm not sure) for Backstreet's Back and Millennium. Can you please verify and is it possible to use this as a source for adding South African certifications?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
