Estimated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: I've read everything again, and I still think it's the right decision. What I'm confused about is if you claim that <url> does not care about capitalisation, how do you explain <url>, <url> and <url> (examples given on the talk page)?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 2:
Text: I think I'll leave it to the Math WikiProject to decide whether the dab page should be at <url> or <url> since they'll be more familiar with the importance of the various functions.  It looks like all of the basic options I was considering are basically OK from the perspective of the DAB project, right?

Example 3:
Text: Since your tube station articles don't actually contain any information, what is the point of them? Why not put them together and work them into an article that says something interesting?
Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 4:

Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 5:

Example 6:
Text: If you keep your eyes focused on the moving toe you can usually catch each instance when you change the rotation direction, I think? Does that tell you anything?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 7:
Text: I have a quick question for you (I'm asking now since I am sure that this is going to be brought up either at the ACR or the FAC, when I finally get there): you've added a "pp." for the citation given for the national defense authorization act of 2007, but the rest of the article makes use of the "p." system. Shouldn't the "pp." be changed to a "p." for conformity, or is the use of the "pp." correct from the perspective of citation guidelines?

Text: I often work out of Sweden and I have an excellent, free, built-in English or Swedish grammar ''and'' spelling program in ''Word'' on that computer using Firefox (as this user says she does) - red underlinings for spelling and green for grammar - which would preclude almost all of the huge amount of problems caused by this user regarding readability, or at least alert her to the very quanitity of the problems and inspire a constructive attitude as to her own capacity. Perhaps if one does not consider it a "duty" of sorts to contribute readable English here, that actually might be the problem?

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 29:
Text: He used it to assert that '''''others''''' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 7:
Text: Just wondering, is there any reason why you removed categories from a number of articles and replaced them with the non-existend <url>. Wouldn't <url> have been the better choice, which, as it appears, is a category you yourself created a few days ago?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 18:
Text: Given the comments <url> (saying that Ganglia also should be added to the bypass list), and the fact that there are about 10 WMF projects, wouldn't it be more effective if there was only a "whitelist" for adding the WMF projects (which all have a secure version), such as Wikipedia, Wikiversity, Wikinews, Wiktionary, etc? Or would there be some drawbacks in doing this?
