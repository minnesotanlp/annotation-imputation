Did you consider that you are asking me to put up an image for which I know the \"fair use\" claim to be bogus, and that this is illegal?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 2:\nText: I'm sorry, but I don't see what you're talking about.  Could you be more specific?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hmm, see you just reverted back. What's the bot's job suppost to be?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: OK, just to make sure there are city, town, village as incorporated places, the townships are districts, and of course CDPs (I want to make the key right). Also, how many parishes are there (perhaps I should have asked this first)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: <url> is one of the three fundamental Wikipedia content policies; why is it a \"shame\" you have to follow it? What did you mean by \"people like you\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: I remember your commenting on this about seven years ago.  What's your view today?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: I really would rather use, in English, the one expression \"<url>\" instead of \"<url>,\" \"marz,\" \"<url>,\" \"khaet,\" \"<url>,\" \"eparchia,\" \"ostan,\" \"khoueng,\" \"faritany,\" \"aimag,\" \"tinh\"u2014or \"<url>\" (aka \"<url>\").  <url> then why should \"<url>\" not be also?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hi Thunderbrand, thanks for letting me know that the image I uploaded is on IFD. Can I ask though, why is the image being deleted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks!  What type of documentation do you want u2014 an explanation of using the notes feature?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: Thanks a ton for looking that up for me. For the purposes of a citation, what are the page numbers for the whole article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: Back on topic Jigglyfidders; I totally agree with Deconstructhis on this one. What will you do to address this issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: I don't know, but that doesn't make any sense to me.  What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 13:\nText: The links were removed but, what rule says it is best to \"double space\"? And what do you plan to rewrite exactly?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 14:\nText: I have to say, I've reviewed the suggestions that \"year in x\" not be piped, and I vehemently disagree. As I note on the [[Wikipedia talk:Piped link|talk page]], \"[s]ee [[Lindsay Lohan]] for a good example of why piping is a good thing (a simple [&#91;2003 in film]] in line would create clunky, hard-to-follow writing&mdash;better to use no links at all).\" Comment?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: I changed back to the complete cast list of Love is in the Air. Hopefully it's OK with you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: Was the location called Amen Corner before he bought the shop there ? If not, perhaps the location is named after the shop rather than vice versa ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: Either way, administrators shouldn't be relying on counting how many categories are there for deletion, even if I accept to create the category only one day in advance. Suppose the bot fails to create the category for a day; then, you'll see only five categories and do no deletions on that day?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: I can certainly suggest to Isarig that 3RR is not an entitlement, and that dicussion is often the better approach. Would you like me to try to mediate the Karsh page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 19:\nText: My question is \"Why?\" I am doing all the citations correctly and this still appears often. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 20:\nText: OTRS. At this point why not try?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: A wikipedia project that serves as a place where users can get signatures, userboxes.... stuff like that, so they don't have to make it themselves or ask a specific user to do it. What do you think of that idea?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: True, tho in reality I should have just blocked the sock tpar from the beginning.  Don't we usually do that to force them to request unblocking on the main account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 23:\nText: Thank you! Was I the only one who found Lima's tone to be, to say the least, unpleasant?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: So basically, I've come across the edit conflict warning, and I simply copy my text, and paste it to the latest version of the article. I think you are saying that people insert 'edit conflict' to show that if any continuity is broken, it is because the comment was intended for a previous version of the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: Again, what would be the point of redirection? Who on earth is going to fall on the redirect first?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: Looking at Kotorkid's contributions on <url>, three hours seems too short for a block.  Considering that their three and only edits were all vandalism, would you support an indef-block for vandalism-only account for them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: It needs to be redirected anyone can do that. Is there any information that is in the article that is not in <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 28:\nText: No worries. So back to my question: what software makes them rock like that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: Sounds good. Could you drop Fritzpoll a note?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: Yes, this is the English Wikipedia so we use the English version of the infobox. And can there once be a time when you don't find your way to my talk a complain?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nHuman-Rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I was trying to be sarcastic, ok??\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 2:\nText: What were the four universities? Drexel, Duquesne, Maine-Orono and ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Very strange, how come I can see all the other posts? How do I clear the cache - do you know?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: I added mention of the river. The info for <url> says the picture was taken in <url>; is that city located on the river?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I see. So what should I do with this sockpuppet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: Evidently, I don't have enough consciousness, because I haven't the foggiest idea of what you're talking about.

Isn't there a barnstar for things like that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: I see you've just placed a deletion request on your user page, but this page has no history and hasn't been edited previously.  Did you mean to place it on the article you created, <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: When you say you emailed Crystal, do you mean ''Crystal Evans, AKA Country Girl in Girl Authority?'' She was the one who wanted me to recieve the Barnstar?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: I don't really get it. In your terminology, is there someone practicing Germanic paganism who is not a neopagan?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: No, I have not read it, as it is of no interest to me or this encyclopedia. Are you claiming that the references make the blog post a reliable source, or why are we still discussing this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 12:\nText: I don't profess to be an expert on the <url>, but note that the Gaelic Wikipedia has ''xc0rcaibh'', redirected from ''Arcaibh''.  Are you certain it should be a short vowel?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: That is the standard ARBMAC (Arbitration related to some Macedonian and other Balkan countries) warning.  Still interested in accepting the deal?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: There is a recommendation on the talk page of the \"<url>\".

Your summary was \"add to discussion\" - can you explain?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hi, I have cleaned up this page and, in the AfD, identified many other sources and additional content. I  wonder if you would reconsider your delete !vote please (I will do the necessary expansion as and when there is a reasonable expectation of it being kept)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 18:\nText: I've tried expanding it a bit, and removed a (somewhat inaccurate) sentence that referred to the chemical structure of anthracyclines. Any better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 19:\nText: I don't recall any consensus on that unilateral change. Can you direct me to it, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: On another subject, have you finished the books I suggested? Want more?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: I am concern why this user never replies to messages left on her talk page. Does she talk?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 22:\nText: Where should he be? As a parent of Isa-Beg?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 23:\nText: I also love your new CA Interstate shields. Could I trouble you to replace the current one for <url> with a similar one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 24:\nText: Yeah, that poor old schlub prolly woulda been me, haha! What a game though, eh?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: But if there is no evidence that it has been downgraded, shouldn't it be kept as a Cat. 2?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: Hello. Can you help me create a map of Isabela which reflects the 3D map?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: I still can't remember how I got into this.

Will you reconsider?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: Yes, I just saw that. DJ, if you wished to delete the still tagged pages then that was your judgement call but to delete pages which I had already declined a speedy on was rather bad form wouldn't you say?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 30:\nText: Richiez, if you are a surgeon, there's a good chance that Intuitive Surgical would bring a robot to your home or office for free so that you could test drive it without further obligation.  What have you got to lose?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I was about to participate in the Afd on Wooster Greeks.  You've reverted yourself and re-closed it?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
