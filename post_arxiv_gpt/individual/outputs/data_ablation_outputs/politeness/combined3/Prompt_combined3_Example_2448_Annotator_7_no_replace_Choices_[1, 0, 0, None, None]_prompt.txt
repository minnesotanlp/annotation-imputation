Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 2:
Text: Lil-Unique told me it with the reasons of what I put in my edit summary, so if you need a better explanation ask him. I left Billboard Hot 100 as Billboard Hot 100 because that's the exact name of the chart?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 3:
Text: I'm linking this to Fumiyo's. Are <url> and <url> among the bullies too?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 4:
Text: Maybe the area that is now the Chakma Autonomous District Council was (or is?) located within the Lawngtali district?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 6:

Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 7:
Text: You added partisan colours for the early Chancellors (such as a conservative blue colour for Bismarck); as the early Chancellors were not attached to any political party, and the "party" given is merely an approximate indication of their political leanings, I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Also, why did you remove the partisan colour from the last part of the table (the Republic)?

Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 10:
Text: I am the third party; <url> was the first to dispute its use.  Why can't you describe the changes in words?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 11:
Text: Um, I'll check it out, 141.158.210.110, but I haven't had a lot of edits (if any) on that article. In the mean time, why not <url> and join the Wikipedia community?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 14:
Text: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 15:
Text: Your "resolution" was to move it back to "Detective Terry Crowley" again? Why do you keep doing that?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 21:
Text: Hi, although I agree with you, please check the following <url> in process. Why can't the darn thing work, in the first place?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 22:
Text: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 23:
Text: What do you think? Is there a mistake somewhere?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 24:
Text: Why did you remove those German emigrant cases. Shouldn't we include those cases of people who was born in what was then Germany at the time?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 25:
Text: Okay, I've read through it, and I'm willing to accept that it's your granddaughter. Shall I delete it?

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 27:

Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 29:
Text: This is what you wrote: "In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times." What book, 1948??
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 30:
Text: By the way. Can you edit your own talk page when it is protected?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Human-rated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: If you were falsely accused of vandalism, the best thing to do is to talk to the user who accused you, and explain why your edit was not vandalism. Which user accused you vandalism?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 2:
Text: But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''<url>'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom?

Example 3:
Text: When we have a GLAM barnstar then you get it ..... just for the Hindi article! I cannot explain why you needed to create a Derby page in Hindi - surely it should be there already?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Annotation from annotator: 4

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 7:
Text: I'm an admin, I'd be happy to do it. You want me to do it now?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 8:
Text: I think that's a good solution.  Should we give it a try?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 9:
Text: If she's been in a lot of porn movies, doesn't that show she is famous. Can't you undelete it and then let it go to a AfD discussion?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 10:
Text: I think a separate security section heading is required in <url> article as it gets prime billing in the introduction, but then has references (and criticisms) scattered throughout the rest of the article.  Do you support this?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 11:
Text: See <url>. I've made them, can you help fill them out and place them in the articles?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 12:
Text: Ok.  By the way, may I note that is an excellent resource you have there.   I noticed the other day that we had acquired a list at <url> of unproduced scripts/stories - it seems entirely genuine and fits with material I have read elsewhere but was uncited - I wonder if you could help find a source for it?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 13:
Text: I don't think I've used it in Wikipedia.  So, if I haven't, why did you bring it up?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 14:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 18:
Text: Wait, what's the COI? Was this on the fringe noticeboards?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 19:
Text: Somewhat related, shouldn't <url>, be renamed to <url>? I realize that Baha'i forbids sectarianism, but this is what the article is about, no?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 20:
Text: Ah, I was confused by the fact that your tag was placed on <url>, not on <url>.  Wildbot has visited, & updated the talk page again, so where is the result of the whole exercise?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 21:
Text: I see you've added <url> to the category "Jewish-Canadians".  What is your source for this?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 23:

Annotation from annotator: 17

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 25:

Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 26:
Text: There hasn't been much progress made in the last three days. Is anyone interested in responding?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 27:
Text: Already past my two "spelling correction" edits ;) (though they are obsessed with defense). I noticed one of them changed a quoted spelling: ''acknowledgment'' to ''acknowledgement'', did you get that one?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 28:
Text: Make that "copyvio tag". OK if I revert under those conditions?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 29:
Text: Hi Thunderbrand, thanks for letting me know that the image I uploaded is on IFD. Can I ask though, why is the image being deleted?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 30:
Text: The Italian and English rules are different from the Spanish. But if you think about it, would it make sense to list every reserve player who makes a first team appearance?
Annotation from annotator: 11
