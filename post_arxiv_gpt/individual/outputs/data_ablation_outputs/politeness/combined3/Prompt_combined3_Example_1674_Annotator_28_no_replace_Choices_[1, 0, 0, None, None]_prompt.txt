Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 6:
Text: Started, shall we post on the <url> page and ask for others to collaborate. Is that a good use of the WikiProject?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Text: But that doesn't follow <url>.  Perhaps you can discuss the idea there?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 8:
Text: Looking at my various edit summaries to <url>, I don't see any where I mentioned anything about another example.  Can you say which edit you have in mind?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 9:
Text: When would any WP policy e.g. <url> require a change in citation style?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 10:

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 11:
Text: A little while back, at the beginning of November, I had said that if you ever were considering adminship, that I would love to support and/or nominate you.  Do you have any interest in pursuing it?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 12:
Text: What is unreliable about the newspaper article reports about the protests in Meliti, Lofi, etc? Are you alleging that the protests against the Greek military did not occur?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 14:
Text: Yes, I appreciate that my edits were not the best, but they are currently the best available in Wikipedia for guiding readers in understanding there the emergence of the legal systems of the United Kingdom. Do You have a better suggestion?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 15:

Annotation from annotator: 14

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:
Text: Yes, nearly every church category seems messed up, going either up or down. It seems a major task to do the whole lot - would it make sense simply to move the Catholics (say) out of the primate tree (by an edit) or is this bypassing the cfd process in some sneaky fashion?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 18:
Text: I just noticed you've added me as a sock puppet for Blue Sea? Can I ask what led you to this conclusion?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 19:
Text: Keeping a list of everything bad user:XXX did in your user space is neither constructive nor appropriate. Perhaps we should both focus on the many positive things to do rather than the very occasional misbehavior?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 20:
Text: Yes I did.  Did you happen to check out <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 22:
Text: Thanks. Does it happen to say anything about his marriage to Paula, as in when it ended?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 23:
Text: Hi Johnuniq, thank you for your edit. Does the file should be deleted/removed from commons then?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 24:
Text: I suggest we start with the History section. What do you think?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 25:

Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 26:

Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 2:
Text: Go to <url> and create it like you would a page: just add a little text by putting in a little explanation at the top and adding categories u2014 see <url> for a basic category of this sort, although on a very different subject.  Let me ask, however: are you planning to categorise articles about schools and/or districts, or articles on the cities where they are based?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 3:
Text: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used "on".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 4:
Text: If the only page you've been visiting is Wikipedia, then it makes sense the viruses would come from here, but if you've been to other sites, they get thrown into the equation. Again, don't you have any anti-virus software?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 5:
Text: I'm disappointed that your first response here was to revert me without discussion, and to assert a consensus that was not apparent.  Before you choose to revert me again, can you ''please'' participate in the discussion at WT:RD?
Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 6:
Text: Thanks, I tried to do that but don't know how to do it? Can you help?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 7:
Text: I haven't. What are you referring to?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 8:
Text: I am out of YUBC (I wonder myself how can I even post here). Could you do it?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 10:

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 11:

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 12:
Text: How are these inconsistent with the traditional account of the origins of the Torah involving redactions as late as Ezra? Why do we need bizarre hypotheses about documents being interwoven that are contrary to all known examples of how books are written?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 13:
Text: "Redirecting is blanking" would be more accurate. Or maybe "redirecting is redirecting"?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 14:
Text: And why exactly am I looking at your monobook?  And why did you substitute your user links onto here?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 15:
Text: Thanks. Anything else?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 16:
Text: I'm sorry, but that does not respond to my question at all. Should I take it to indicate a no?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 17:
Text: Actually, I think the only problem with linking the characters like this is that the underlining can be kind of distracting and the page can get a little harder to edit.  I wonder if there is some way to modify the Wikipedia software so that Chinese characters would automatically link to their corresponding Wiktionary page?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 18:
Text: To be perfectly honest, I really have no idea what you're talking about.  Would it not be simpler to just ''add'' a link to the template (if that is indeed what you mean) than to create a potentially offensive and almost certain to be rapidly deleted category?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 19:
Text: Then why is the article for the monastery in Lhasa as "Ganden" instead of "Gandan"? Do both the monasteries have the same name?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 20:
Text: LOL what did he say in the press???
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 21:
Text: Is there any point to the quotation that's not served equally by the link on its own?  Other than the obvious (which I'd like to think you're above), which is trolling the student pollies?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 22:
Text: What you really need to do if you want an article on 'Do Anything Nice' is to establish its notability. Can you find multiple non-trivial mentions in reliable sources that refer to it?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 23:
Text: Hello - some of your writing is a bit hard to understand. Is English your first language, out of curiousity?
Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 24:
Text: Regrettably, I know little about <url>. Which dermatology-related articles have you seen me editing?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 25:
Text: Not that clear to me. What's wrong with this username?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 26:
Text: Sorry about that. I guess instructions are there for a reason, right?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 27:
Text: He used it to assert that '''''others''''' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 28:
Text: Thanks for responding, at any rate. <smile> Protocol question, as I'm new here: If a discussion is unproductive, should one just delete it?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 29:
Text: Thanks for your response! How should we proceed ?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 30:
Text: To ''Arbcom''? Aren't we being a bit dramatic here when other forms of dispute resolution have not been tried?
Annotation from annotator: 7
