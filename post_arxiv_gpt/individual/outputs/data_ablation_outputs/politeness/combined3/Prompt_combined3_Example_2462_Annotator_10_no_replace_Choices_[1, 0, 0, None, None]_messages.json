Isn't that what the \"Nominations 7 days or older - Decision Time\" section is for?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 11:\nText: I was aware of that part of <url>, but I don't see its relevance here. Do you say that considering the audience is an arbitrary standard?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 12:\nText: I don't like the idea of switching the order halfway through, especially as you would you have to decide an arbitrary cut-off point.

Maybe we could do a collab for an article related to Thalia (once I'm finished with some work)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 22:\nText: As for restoring the image, no I will not.

Are you interested in working on this in the coming week or so?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: Could you please block me indefinitely.

How can I do that if the army corps aren't sections?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 13:\nText: Sorry for the late reply, but I usually check new additions from the bottom of the page, not the top. What is your disappointment regarding?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 14:\nText: Another admin has already deleted the article. Do you need me to restore it for you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 15:\nText: A long time ago, you deleted this article. How can I see the content previously in the discussion page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 16:\nText: It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided.

Have you willpower?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 24:\nText: I've deleted the diagram from the <url> article because, as Curtis Clark points out in <url>, the diagram does not represent the results of the reference it purports to represent.

For now, Celine's infobox says \"CBS Records Canada (1986u20131990)\", but since her discography owner/copyright holder is still Sony Canada, should I change this to Sony Music Canada (1986-present)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 27:\nText: Josiah, believe me, I understand how you feel, and unless you really feel like it, I don't think you should involve yourself in the dispute, because it seems intractable.
