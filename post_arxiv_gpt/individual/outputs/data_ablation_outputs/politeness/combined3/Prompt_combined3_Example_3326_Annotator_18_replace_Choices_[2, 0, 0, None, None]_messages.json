Or do you have any actual arguments to counter my post?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 8:\nText: He's taken the notice down.  Doesn't this count as belaboring the point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 9:\nText: You lost me J.

Do you not recall that instance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: Hello, it was requested that some of the details be removed so as to make the article a bit more general. Is that ok?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: I'm trying to keep Minority Report as a GA, and the <url> requested for copyediting - but didn't give examples to cleanup.

Can we say that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 13:\nText: It is the choice of template name as \"Shinto2\" which seems IMHO poor for use within an article (i.e. the \"2\" bit), hence suggestion of <nowiki><url></nowiki> (distinct from <nowiki><url></nowiki> currently used for various talk page headers), or if you don't like that as a name then perhaps <nowiki><url></nowiki> (invoked as <person>) ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Thank you for telling me.

Have you read the Grafen paper?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 29:\nText: I'd have done it in half the time if I knew how to format cites, so might have had time to copyedit too. Now I need it moved to the correct title - where's a friendly admin when you need one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: I got the same email.  Isn't this a proxy account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Where is the exception in <url> for \"tossing out citations and verifiable in order to make it easier for the reader\"?
