What kind of messed up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: Molte grazie, just one last thing, if this is the only source then how I'm supposed to cite it there. Do you have any better way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 3:\nText: The block has indeed expired.  What message are you getting when you try to edit?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: Jenny and Silas info should surface within the week, Daily Mail will have some reception for him and her. \"India's murder\" and \"Fued with Lynsey Nolan\" maybe?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi there. On a tangential note, would you happen to be <person>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: I looked at all the provinces and regencies listed on <url> - so that trick is mostly played out. I'm going down the alphabet now and I'm at the R's - if you want to work, maybe you could start at the end of the alphabet so we don't interfere with each other, meet in the middle?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 7:\nText: I forgot to add, above, that Jed's site also hosts some anti-CF papers.  So, if ALL the papers there are garbage, those would be, too, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 8:\nText: hahah, thanks! Must admit, when I saw the title of this section I was thinking \"oh lord, another what-is-the-wiki-coming-to comment..\" :p. How goes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: Again, why are you simply reverting wholesale and without any explanation? Would you rather the article be out of line with the policies and guidelines, among other problems?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 10:\nText: I was thinking on it, but one question: I see several articles either deleted or promoted to FA after the oldid the sweeps uses. I'm assuming we simply ignore these?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Unless im making a major mistake here, this article was about a Not for profit organisation which seemed notable enough to give the origional creator at least some time to source it. Are you sure this had to be a speedy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 12:\nText: Also, i'd like to know what you think of William Harris. Is he affiliated with the Discovery Institute?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 13:\nText: Hmm, I'm not sure...maybe you need to clear your cache? Or did you create the new username first, before asking me to change your old one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: Currently, <url> is a subcategory of <url>. What would you suggest doing about this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 15:\nText: I just wanted to mention, I haven't been on VIA since I was 12 or so, and I've never taken a Greyhound bus to or from London...but I don't recall there being overwhelming complaints about VIA.  I mean, there is general complaining, like there always is about any transportation system...isn't it faster than the bus though, even if it is more expensive?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: Acad, I see we have one fairly ambiguous comment at <url>, dealing with hyphenation, which is one of the things we agree on, if memory serves.  Any advance on 4 people who care?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: Who is going to contact all of the users?  Is a bot being set to do that in the event it's necessary, or is it being done manually?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 18:\nText: I seeu2014yes, those can easily be changed back. Would you rather I start a fresh discussion about these?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 19:\nText: You speedy-delete-tagged <url> and <url> as <nowiki><person></nowiki>. What maintenance work were you weanting to do with them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: Ah okay. In that case I'm going to tag it for deletion as a redundant redirect, if that's okay with you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 21:\nText: I guess I must have misunderstood, sorry for that. Exactly what do you mean by having my promise to not use the tools for a year enforced by a bureaucrat?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 22:\nText: I'm also a bit weary of this discussion, and I'm afraid the central argument stands. But perhaps if you wish to continue it, you'd do a bit of the searching, and report your results?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 23:\nText: Why did you remove the pollution references on <url>. Do you have a source which refutes this claim?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 24:\nText: I would like to nominate you for adminship.  Would you accept now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 25:\nText: Have you as yet cast your own vote for <url>? Is there anything you can do to address some of the questions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 26:\nText: Stephen's solution certainly isn't optimal. Fancy giving me a basic rundown on the problem here and I'll see if I can devise a more elegant one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: Just noticed that the \"time\" field is eliminated from the collapsable boxes. Could you make this something that is displayed when the box is expanded?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 28:\nText: Is your username Davshul? When would you be online?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: Say what? And what does this have to do with \"Happy New Year\" and my pretty picture?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 30:\nText: Are you kidding me? Do you even bother to click on <url> to see its fleet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nHuman-Rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was \"Left-libertarianism in political philosophy\".  If it were changed back to something like that and moved to the top, would that be satisfactory?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: So argument that \"''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''\" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: No problem, done. What's your connection to Casey?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've been \"busy\" (all day today in Death Valley admiring the spring bloom), and I would like to get at least partial buyin from HG if possible. Not a big hurry to rename, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: So you are still sidestepping the question.  Please answer it directly:  please answer my question, clearly:  are you saying is that you cannot use the wiki to edit cooperatively with other people on the same text, or are you saying that you can use the wiki as it was intended and edit a single text cooperatively?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 6:\nText: I'd be glad to help, if you like. How should we divide it, by section or by criteria?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hey, what was with the fact tag? Do you dispute its name?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 8:\nText: You may need to enable your own setting to allow E-mail too; I'm not sure. If so, maybe you can turn it on temporarily, so that you can send me one e-mail?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 9:\nText: I see you have a BugZilla account. How do you make it so it doesn't show your email to everybody?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Hope that you don't mind, I modified your comment in the Craig intro, using a nice new template that I found.  Check it out: what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Hmmm, Dev, Jet123's nom doesn't really count as your second one, right? I can overwrite it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 12:\nText: I have not seen quotation sections on any other Australian politician page. Also, who chose these \"quotations?\" What qualifies as a quotation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: Thank you for the links and the explanation. I'd like to help with the project, what did you have in mind?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hmm. Over?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 15:\nText: I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the \"sh\" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 16:\nText: Thanks; I expected a decline, despite my extensive comments at <url>. As there is nothing more to this article than listings of bylines in non-notable publications, minor book acknowledgments, uncredited movie extra roles, blog comments, paid directory listings, and unsubstantiated claims about wildly over-the-top PR accomplishments, what exactly do you consider to be the examples of \"credible notability\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 17:\nText: Why nominate this for deletion? It was obviously created by someone who didn't know how to use redirects, so would it not be best to just correct it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 18:\nText: So, I'm a \"deletion fanatic\"? Why don't you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 19:\nText: That's nice. May I ask why you noticed this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 20:\nText: I was thinking more of making the line longer so that the team's name can fit on it. Is that doable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: I agree with Deb. Is there anything else you are interested in besides city planning?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: I removed that second paragraph entirely, since the information is covered in the article.  Do you feel that the lead should be larger?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 23:\nText: You had problems with both versions? Do you have cookies enabled in <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 24:\nText: Unfortunately for those who like railroads, it's been closed again! DOn't you people have better things to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 25:\nText: Thanks for your additional categorizing. :) I guess I could just look at your contributions, but before catting, what \"work\" were you doing previously?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: Meh - perhaps not, and they will most likely be closed as renames, but I figured another week to allow anyone who wants to to comment wouldn't hurt anything since you as the nominator were the only one who had commented so far. Is there something I missed, or a hurry to get these quickly renamed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: Sure thing, you've been doing great work so far. Would it help to maybe translate the whole article first as it is, and then over the course of time you can play around with the sections and add stuff that you find?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 28:\nText: Interesting; I thought I was fairly familiar with Wikipedia rules. Which rules exactly did I violate by closing an AfD (allegedly) without reading the underlying article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 29:\nText: It appears that that article was deleted because not enough info was found on the person. Doesn't the new article have enough info?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 30:\nText: Unless you provide a wikipedia article, with solid references od proof of notability of the term, I am going to delist it. I ave no doubts that there was a dilike of Portugals (like any other major nation), but was this word in notable circulation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Thanks a lot for clearing that up. Do you also happen to know about the age of consent in Thailand, and why he could be charge with child sex offenses even though she was 17 years old?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
