Suggestion on what you'd like to see in the way of resolution?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 2:\nText: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 3:\nText: Sorry to bother you but theres a report on <url> regarding <url> which has been a target for IP vandalism. I'm only asking directly  because the vandalism is continuing and I'm close to not being able to fight it anymore under policy so can I ask if you could please issue the protection and revert the IP's vandalism back to my last revision?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 4:\nText: Is it referring to a different bank of a similar name? What source is it from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi, I was wondering why it is that <url> only has two articles in it -- and whether it should be kept. Has it ever been more fully populated?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: Your \"resolution\" was to move it back to \"Detective Terry Crowley\" again? Why do you keep doing that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hi Cmadler, I've written a new ALT hook at the <person> that I think addresses your concerns.  Could you sign off on the nomination?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: <url>???\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 9:\nText: One other question I have is that the ''Wikipedia'' article states that his 1968 paper had been first rejected by American publications before it was accepted by the British one. Would you happen to know why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 10:\nText: <url> It would be better if the content was not quite so pejorative. Perhaps a rewording?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 11:\nText: I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding your question. Could you try again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 12:\nText: Would you email me with any points/incidents you especially want me to be aware of?  Do you think Jimbo will be willing to pass this to the arbitration committee?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: If the procedure for afd/copyvio is the same, that could certainly be possible. Can you please provide a link to the appropriate pages/templates in that language?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 14:\nText: I'll have a look (probably just for copyediting duties) once Zag has finished the larger changes. Keep me posted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 15:\nText: ---- Though I thought I would note that you have now exceeded <big>'''500'''</big> edits while on \"wikibreak\" and that is over less than 10 days, May I ask what kind of break is that???\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 16:\nText: PS I also am wondering about the letter \"ll\". It seems, like the Welsh <url>, to have a particular (and tricky) pronunciation, but thereu2019s nothing on the <url> or <url> pages about it: Can you shed any light on this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: It looks like the category functioning works.  Can we get an alert to render instead of the default missing parameter <nowiki>{{{1}}}}</nowiki> behaviour?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 18:\nText: It's a possibility, but still leaves the problem that the terms are US Army jargon (at least, I don't recall hearing them anywhere else!). Maybe a transwiki to Wiktionary would be better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 19:\nText: I note also that so far you seem to be the sole editor who favors deletion, while several have favored retention of the article, possibly with editing. Could it be that your view does not command consensus?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 20:\nText: I was about to ask the same question on <url>.  Did you ever find out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 21:\nText: Sounds good to me. Should we start preparing for it now just in case the GA reviewer notices that something significant is missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 22:\nText: Congratulations! You are the winner of <url> Round 10. Would you like to prepare the questions for the next Wikifun?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 23:\nText: I hope Ed's doesn't look like mine. Wait--what is this navbar we're talking about?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 24:\nText: I just sat through last Sunday's horror show... The less said about that the better. Any idea who Maurice LaMarche voiced so I can update the guest star list?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 25:\nText: Ha, you're too kind to me, my old friend. MK one day, promise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: I seeu2014yes, those can easily be changed back.

Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 30:\nText: I've made some improvements to <url>, keeping in mind your previous comments about the article. Since you gave its grade before, would you like to see it if it could be reassessed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Wanted to Email you about Wikimedia Converence Netherlands, but your email is not working. In any case, you could crash at our place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 2:\nText: I noticed that you twice placed a request for citation on the <url> page,<url> <url>, but it was silently removed by <url> <url>. I've removed the sentence altogether; do you think any other action should be taken at this point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 3:\nText: |style=\"vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px;\" | Hi, I wish to understand why you deleted my file. I'm kinda new here, can you help me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 4:\nText: I'm trying to figure out what he did differently from any of the other editors continually arguing (for months) about the South Ossetia War. Sure, he argues passionately for his viewpoint, but hasn't everyone that was involved in that article done so, including myself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: What a joke, this player has played league football all his career and some clown has now deleted it off, what kind of rules has this been deleted under then? \"May be deleted\" seems a bit of a poor excuse to me personally, fancy giving me some information as to why this has been deleted then guys?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 6:\nText: Why did you just do that? I am being serious - what business was it of yours exactly?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 7:\nText: I was discussing this with Ling.Nut, since I've seen them around before.  What do you think of a founding member userbox for yourself, me and Ling?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hi Dirk. Does the two books you cited for the heavy Belgian <url> losses have any info of how many Gladiators the Belgians lost, and perhaps what losses they incurred on the Germans?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 9:\nText: re: <url> edit.

Are you bringing it to DYK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 12:\nText: The YA article is a right trainwreck, and having had to do much of the exact same work on <url> and <url>, I'm not keen to do it again a third time on <url>, and then defend three separate articles from identical POV pushes. Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 13:\nText: Why doesnt belong there??\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: If you are beccoming a target again do you want semi prot for a while?

What is \"Expulsions\" here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 22:\nText: Many thanks. I can't resolve \"The work represents a summary of themes explored in Bacon's previous paintings\", Tony's right - its clunky and unclear; any ideas?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 23:\nText: How do you know the author/uploader of <url> intended it to be licenced under the copyright licence that you attached to the file with <url> Are you clairvoyant or did the uploader tell you this was his wish?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 24:\nText: This Latvian Scout image has Zemgale in the name, but the Latvian name is 6000 miles away buried in storage.
