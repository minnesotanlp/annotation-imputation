Example 13:
Text: <url>. What do you think should be done?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Annotation from annotator: 8

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 3:
Text: In retrospect "in as far away as" looks ungrammatical. Shouldn't it just be "as far away as"?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 4:
Text: Hey, so your move of this, and wanted to point out that the reason I put a disambig title on it, was because there are two different labor unions of the same name, either one of which could wind up with an article. But, I don't know that that means the article should automatically get the title, is there a standard for this situation?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 5:
Text: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Annotation from annotator: 20

Annotation from annotator: 8

Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 17:
Text: Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don't (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Text: I'm confused: what did you do?  And how did you delete it twice without restoring it in between?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 19:

Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 20:
Text: Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 21:
Text: I noticed that you changed the formatting for <url> slightly, putting the links to 18-crown-6 and en to the sentence after the chemical structure rather than in the chemical structure itself. Why is that?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 22:
Text: After <url> <url>, all/most of the needs specified have been completed. Do you think its worth re-nominating <url> for FA or GA status?

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 27:

Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 28:
Text: ''You wrote:'' I'm not trying to be obtuse, but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn't apply because the assertion of notability has been made?
Annotation from annotator: 4
