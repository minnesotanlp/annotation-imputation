But let's make sure our answers are accurate by using <url> rather than something we heard someone say, eh?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 2:\nText: I'm not sure if you've changed your opinion of the article's FAC status, but I think you have guided us in a ton of good ideas.  Have you changed your opinion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: Well, yes, obviously (but I sort of assumed that the same exemptions would apply to 1RR as 3RR - is that not the case?) Should I self-rv?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 4:\nText: Steineresque! Shall I have a go, or will you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Actually, if she is releasing a new single from the debut album, the title \"Home Run\" wouldn't encompass this. Someone else has changed it to \"Debut album\" which I think is more suiting, what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: I think it's a great idea to get the CO3 community involved with keeping <url> correct and uptodate.  I shan't be there myself this year (clashes with various things) - would you be able to bring it up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Unfortunately I think <url> may also add that material; I am not familiar with Citizendum, though, but I will look at it. If Citizendum has the same policies regarding primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, then why not criticize both Wikipedia and Citizendum?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 8:\nText: Do you sign your name using 4 tildes? (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: You know, occasionally, Momoricks will send me a note telling how one of my snarkier edit summaries made her laugh. Is that the case for the triple-misspell revert I did?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 10:\nText: Emico, you have to understand that sometimes people use different words to describe the same thing. If I find a source saying \"Hitler killed himself\" and I write \"Hitler committed suicide\" am I wrong because the word ''suicide'' isn't in the sources?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 11:\nText: Are you sure that you want to withdraw your nomination to delete the 2 old articles? Don't you want the 2 articles deleted since they have been merged into something much better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 12:\nText: I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the \"sh\" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 13:\nText: I agree with you in that this chapter has no place on <url>, moreover its inclusion there seems highly suspicious. Is there any way to see who added a particular word/sentence/paragraph without manually going through the history?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: I find it done both ways on the web.  If some convention requires capitalizing it even though it's not anything like a proper noun, I think that should get explained in the article, otherwise reasonable people will wonder who it's named after: someone named Saros, but what's his first name and where's the Wikipedia article about him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: Denied. I take it then that you deny responsiblity for an account (which I'll not name here) created just four minutes after you made that edit?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 16:\nText: I have put another warning on <url> with full details of the vandalism. Can this be reported to London Grid, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 17:\nText: These edits appear to be related to the same issue that caused the page to be protected. Could you please explain why you are doing this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 18:\nText: I've heard about the controversy. What's your take on it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 19:\nText: I remember your commenting on this about seven years ago.  What's your view today?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: I was just about to point that out. Is that permitted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: Are you both \"Dribblingscribe\" and \"Indiestu\" ? Do both those accounts belong to the same person?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: Could possibly be. Have you tagged any of the non-free images for review?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: This is my first time at review-sorry if I blew it.  The article passes just fine--what do I do at DYK to indicate that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 24:\nText: Thanks for the redactions :). Is it worth getting a third opinion at the reliable sources noticeboard vis a vis the use of law textbooks for points of law?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: How does it feel being wikifamous??\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: I'm gonna go ahead and do it. Thoughts before I proceed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 27:\nText: Thanks.  Is Brazil4Linux doing anything particully bad right now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: Noticed your nice ''<url>'' photograph. Perhaps you were on the Siruvani bird survey ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 29:\nText: You are obviously very busy. How should I proceed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 30:\nText: Why am I never asked to write a feature. Is it because \"I is black\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Thank you for telling me. Can you please revert my deletion, for I do not yet know how to do so?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 2:\nText: But I don't know anything about central europe. Have you tried the normal dispute resolution avenues?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hmm, well I'll see before judging.  Does it also allow them to be listed from newest-to-oldest and separated into Russian and English references?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: I'm not sure I understand what this has to do with what I said.  Could you restate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi, I found two sources which state that <url> was still married and when she moved to Harlem with her Husband. Do you have any sources to the contrary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: Okay, I will be glad to help you here! Could you please list the username you would want now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Miten sxe4 osaat nii hyvin suomee jos sun xe4idinkieli on kumminki englanti? Onks sul suomenkieliset vanhemmat tai jotai vai ootsxe4 vaa opiskellu ite tosi paljo suomee?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: Yes, and there has been a user from an AOL IP who has been trolling Pilotguy for weeks. Why must you blindly disagree with everything anyone says to you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: I give that a huge second. Why haven't you signed onto the wikiproject yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 11:\nText: Stephen's solution certainly isn't optimal. Fancy giving me a basic rundown on the problem here and I'll see if I can devise a more elegant one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: <url> has a discussion (well kinda right now, I'm still waiting for the initiator to actually explain himself) about the fair use strength of images on episode lists (why there and not on <url>'s talk page is beyond me.  Care to chime in?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 13:\nText: I don't understand why Hong is so reluctant to revert unilateral changes from time-to-time when he did so frequently in the past when I or someone else who supported my edits did it. What exactly is the point in me agreeing to this if someone conveniently comes along and then starts making lots of changes that I don't like but Giovanni doesn't mind?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 14:\nText: You're a troll. Why not go somewhere else?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 15:\nText: eh, i've ALWAYS hated 50 meter pools (200 butterfly was always the BIGGEST pain in the ass) although i really did like butterfly for some reason.... never quite got that, so was it an indoor or outdoor pool????\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 16:\nText: You are talking about direktor, right? He begin the edit war again, as seen by diffs, so C was blocked instead of direktor, see?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 17:\nText: Yes, I apologize, my friend (I guess I have some kind of a phobia that you will forget about my posts :) ) I will wait as long as you want me to. Could you read Mir Harven's posts on talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: SPI is not for just simple yes no answers. Why did you not warn the Minneapolis IP, they are warring as much as Bb23?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 19:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: The links were removed but, what rule says it is best to \"double space\"? And what do you plan to rewrite exactly?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 21:\nText: No problem, done. What's your connection to Casey?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 22:\nText: Thank you very much for your kind comments but I don't recall if or when I made these contributions. Are you sure it was me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 23:\nText: Thanks a lot for clearing that up. Do you also happen to know about the age of consent in Thailand, and why he could be charge with child sex offenses even though she was 17 years old?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 24:\nText: It may very well have been a better candidate for a stub rather than a speedy deletion. I would rather not talk about this on another users talk page, if you would like to discuss if further could we continue any further posts on <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Is there any way I could talk you into being more conservative with creation of new articles?  Do you agree that some of what you're creating here would be seen as obviously deletable material by most editors?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: The above username has been indefinitely banned as a phishing account. Now why would they want my login details...?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: Thanks. Oh, and if you don't mind, would you please block the sockmaster?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 28:\nText: Oh I know, but I think that's a ''problem''. Unless there is some other cat for modem companies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 29:\nText: See: <url>. If I remember correctly, you said you planned on cleaning up after the bot tagged the images; is that still the case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 30:\nText: I've deleted the old versions of ''Winnie the Pooh'' and ''Prom'', but I haven't deleted the other two yet: on the ''Elite Force'' image, the image you've uploaded says \"Mac\" on the box, while the description says it's for the PC; and the external link supplied for the ''127 Hours'' poster shows the original image that was here. Shouldn't these be made consistent first?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Im sorry to see that you withdrew. Maybe next time?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
