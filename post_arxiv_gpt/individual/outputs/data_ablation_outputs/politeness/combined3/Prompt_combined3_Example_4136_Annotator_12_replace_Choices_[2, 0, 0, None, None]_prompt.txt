Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 4:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 14:
Text: I have to say, I've reviewed the suggestions that "year in x" not be piped, and I vehemently disagree. As I note on the [[Wikipedia talk:Piped link|talk page]], "[s]ee [[Lindsay Lohan]] for a good example of why piping is a good thing (a simple [&#91;2003 in film]] in line would create clunky, hard-to-follow writing&mdash;better to use no links at all)." Comment?

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:
Text: Either way, administrators shouldn't be relying on counting how many categories are there for deletion, even if I accept to create the category only one day in advance.

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 24:
Text: So basically, I've come across the edit conflict warning, and I simply copy my text, and paste it to the latest version of the article.

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 30:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 11:

Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 12:
