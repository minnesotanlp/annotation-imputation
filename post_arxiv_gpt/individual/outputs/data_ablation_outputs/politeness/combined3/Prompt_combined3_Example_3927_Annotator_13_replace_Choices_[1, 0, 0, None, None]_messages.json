Can you make a comment in this discussion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: Also, I was looking at the edit history for <url>, as I thought I had created the page (honestly I cannot remember), but the history prior to your move of the list to <url> is missing.  Do you know what happened to it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: Yes, I posted a link to the history. I was asking/thinking where you stepped into the discussion and if you were editing as an IP and that would put a different slant on your 3rr warning to Bbb23?, have you been recently editing the article was the simple question?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi, just noticed you reverted this page back to its pre-COPYVIO state.  Any reason you didn't use the content at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: I find it hard to believe one editor (even one so prolific as RickK) can have much of an effect overall. Do contributors on either side have any (non-anecdotal) evidence that suggests otherwise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 6:\nText: I'm highly in favor of \"exposing Wikipedia's users\" to these excellent pictures; that should go for ''all'' of Wikipedia's users, not just the ones who use this English edition.  What do you think: could we add a note to <url> encouraging people to put their FPCs on the Commons?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Nice continued work on the expressway articles.  Is it possible to have some maps or schematic diagrams showing the location or routes of the expressways?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hey, I see you've been contributing! Time to lose the \"leaving Wikipedia\" box?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 9:\nText: You realize the bot maintains a separate page, right? Is it not possible that the \"problem\" is having the pages inconsistent?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 10:\nText: Don't worry I understand. Using igloo I assume?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 11:\nText: If you're not going to reply then I will undo the edit. Again, why have \"Fictional martial artists\" over the sub-cat \"Anime and manga martial artists\" and not use alphabetical order?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hi there again, just reminding you that the review must be archived over at WP:Biography as well, not only marked as such in the article Talk page. Do you think Markus's last concern was addressed to his satisfaction?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 13:\nText: Ideally, we add it to <url>, because that article is terribly bad, and this is a good starting point for a ''major'' part of it.  I assume the sources are not OR?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: What do you mean by \"one edit war away\"? And whats a siteban?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 15:\nText: You created <url>, there is already a page that similar <url>. Why don't you mix 2 articles together?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 16:\nText: Agree, it would need RFC. One question - should we set up 2 RFCs, as the RFC draft itself suggests - one for the general principle, and the other (separate) for specific REVDEL critieria which the community may or may not endorse, discuss, or make suggestions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 17:\nText: No, Wikipedia does not consider itself (or wikis in general) as a reliable source. Surely you know such a basic policy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 18:\nText: I tend not to be an RFC closer -- apologies. Hopefully someone else will?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 19:\nText: Hi - how's it going?  Do you need more time?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 20:\nText: I understand, it could be quite time consuming. Maybe we could do a collab for an article related to Thalia (once I'm finished with some work)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 21:\nText: Could you clarify this? You're claiming that Betacommand knew before drama exploded onwiki that you were Pickbothmanlol, but did not share that with the community?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 22:\nText: You might want to look at <url> then. Should I do to <url>, <url>, <url> (and others) like you did to Jake Ryan (eg, removing words like \"a\" and \"the\" in the beginning of sentences)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 23:\nText: Still at 1024 x 768 here '''Zangar''' and still looks fine to me. What about putting one of the images into the infobox using the piped 'static image=' parameter?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: I tried to create a similar map for Canada but couldn't get a usable output from the site you used for the Australia map. Could you create a Canadian one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sorry about that. I guess instructions are there for a reason, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 26:\nText: I want to purchase a macro lens and was hoping for some guidance from you. Apart from being good in macro, can it be used to take good pictures of landscape and portraits?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: That should be good now. Except isn't it el-Senussi not El Senussi?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 28:\nText: They're back again - this time with IP 37.105.37.15 (also from Saudi Telecom Co DSL). Fortunately Jasper Deng stepped in - I presume they're an admin of some sort?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: Is the new draft at <url> OK with you? Do you have any comments or suggestions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 30:\nText: I also have problems with a lot of the other recategorisation you have done to these articles, but I won't revert any more until I hear from you.  Taking <url> as an example: why have you removed it from <url> when it clearly is a linear filter; why remove it from <url> when it forms part of image parameter theory; why does an article which discusses electronic designs not belong in <url>; why remove it from <url> when, obviously, it is a term?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Hey, long time no seeing! How's stuff?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 2:\nText: A quick question: I've noticed that people (including yourself) have been moving links to other wikis from the top of the article to the bottom. If this a good thing to do, then I can do likewise, but I wondered if there was a rationale / convention here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 3:\nText: That's a good idea. What about army and corps HQs though?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: Thanks for your reply. I've tried to incorporate the references into the article; how is it now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: Tell me, after your uni starts again, will you not be as present again? And when does it get over?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 6:\nText: Hullo. How goes it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: no, not funny, unless you are a mentally challenged person. Why don't you find a better hobby where you don't post lies and offend the people of Tibet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 8:\nText: The standard would be <person> (as we discussed at some length at the proposals page), to avoid the clumsy double plural.  Any objection if I change it back?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 9:\nText: Huh? Is that a web address or a wikilink?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: Yes, I'd seen your note, but it looks as though all five of those edits were made by users other than Terra. Do you have any reason to suspect they are his sockpuppets?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 11:\nText: I am very confused right now. Please make it clearer to me how I vandalized?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: Well, look again! Does ''<url>'' look like a dictionary-definition page to you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 2\n\nExample 13:\nText: Hi, I meant to do this a long time ago, but I guess I forgot.  You are the \"Sandpiper\" on the HP wiki right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 14:\nText: Mind <url>. Since when one edit after protection expiry is disruptive editing or editwarring?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 15:\nText: Sure thing. Did you see my note higher up on the page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: By the way. Can you edit your own talk page when it is protected?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: lol thanks. so, australia, huh?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: ???You wat?\nAnnotation from annotator: 2\n\nExample 19:\nText: You recently attached a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag to an article about an Azeri poet. May I ask why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 20:\nText: That's really nice! Did you decide against seeing vervandelt as dependent on \"sich\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 21:\nText: Moonriddengirl, is there a specific reason to why they want to use the crop? Is it because there's attribution on it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: I'd be more than happy to :) It may take a while as I've got other stuff on, but as long as you're in no immediate hurry all should be well. Do you have any preferences/requirements for the end result?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 23:\nText: Do you think we're good to go with the proposal, maybe later tonight, or tomorrow? Any other problems with the proposal as it stands?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 24:\nText: What are your intentions after two months?  Will you continue your previous deletions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Strikehold previously did a <url>.  What do you think about adding it to the template?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 26:\nText: So, I'm a \"deletion fanatic\"? Why don't you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 27:\nText: And wasting our time as well. I can only repeat: why don't you do constructive work by adding contents about your beloved Makedonia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: '''Wiki-star''': Hm? Is there a reason for your sorrow my good man?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: Why did you \"nowiki\" the unblock template?  Is it just here for show, or do you want it to be considered?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: What are your views on <url>? And how can you provide a source for a signature?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Interesting.  Would you mind asking at which Sae Gae seminar on what date it was taken?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
