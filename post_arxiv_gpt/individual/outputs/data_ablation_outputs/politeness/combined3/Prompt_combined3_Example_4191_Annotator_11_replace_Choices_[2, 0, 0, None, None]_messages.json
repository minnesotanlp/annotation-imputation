The GLAM WIKI conference could do with being highlighed by a non US/UK hook?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 2:\nText: Thanks terribly for looking it up. Would it be alright for me to use the new source in Europe, economy section then?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hey, I just tried to link to Marat Ayin and it came up as a red link. Do you know if we have an article on it and I'm just not using the right transliteration or do we really not have an article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: Are you really denying that you brought Giano and Bishonen's names into this? Seriously?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: The admin says he thinks it should be renamed, but someone else is trying to pull the \"but it happened in the same area nonsense\". Was I clear enough in explaining where the pictures are listed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: You lost me J. I did the edits because I remember you telling me that repeating things that are already in the wiki-link is unneeded and/or redundant. Do you not recall that instance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 7:\nText: Help how? Do you mean disambiguating links like this:<url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: But the main question was that would it be a bad idea to make more articles about characters, orginizations and etc. in a book?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: I'm with you - it really is a friggin' pain that people refuse to read no matter how big you put the text.  Should we just maybe remove the source entirely?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 10:\nText: I apologize if I have misunderstood.  Are you not an acknowledged devotee of Prem Rawat?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: WHADDAFUCK YA GONNA DO TO ME, HUH BITCH!?????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 12:\nText: AnonEMouse, I have noticed today that there are many recent comments on the <url> talk page that do not show in \"history\". How can that happen?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: Especially considering that it took you ''a lot'' more time to vandalize the page than the two seconds it took us to fix it. What's the point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 14:\nText: I'm glad you made things calculate automatically (and I trust you've tested it!). Shouldn't we update the <url> to not show the unneeded variables, then?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: I looked at all the provinces and regencies listed on <url> - so that trick is mostly played out. I'm going down the alphabet now and I'm at the R's - if you want to work, maybe you could start at the end of the alphabet so we don't interfere with each other, meet in the middle?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 16:\nText: I don't see the references anywhere. Do you mean the \"glimcher website\" and \"official website\" links?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: It is disputed among admins regarding the protection of userpages, although the policy says that users can have their user/user sub-pages (but not the talks) semi-protected if the user requests it. Are there other subpages of yours that you'd like protecting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 18:\nText: It just doesn't make sense (to me) that we use a manga spelling for one name but a Simmons' spelling for another. Can't we just go along with Simmons on this one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 19:\nText: Well, lyrics are generally frowned upon on Wikipedia, unless the song is old enough that its copyright no longer applies. Could you perhaps link to the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 20:\nText: Halfling may be another name for Hobbit, but the model for the Hobbit encouraged the creation of other Halflings. Nevertheless it is a Halfling, is it not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: Your bot runs awfully fast. How come there isn't \"using AWB\" in the edit summary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 22:\nText: I couldn't find your \"email user\" function. What's up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 23:\nText: Yet you did violate <url> and could be blocked right now. If that edit recurred, would you revert it again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: APS = <url>. You lost me, which plant are you referring to above?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: In the summer (June-July) I am going to work on the ''Messiah'' article. Would you like to be in on this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: I have just reported a high level of Vandalism at the page <url>. Is it possible to impose a temporary protection to the page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: What is your objection?  Would a split address your concerns?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 28:\nText: That's a <url>-length rant. Still, be nice and AGF, okay?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 29:\nText: Do you understand now what was wrong with your edits? What do you intend to do if unblocked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: I believe it was I who moved it, based on what appeared to be consensus to use the hyphen in that context.  Where is this guideline of which you speak that suggests otherwise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nHuman-Rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Still doing vandalism reverts by hand I see. Need any help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 2:\nText: Indeed, the New York Times tells us that Iain Hook \"''was shot in the back by an Israeli soldier ''\". Why did a member of the IDF shoot him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: I don't think so, Giano. Can we just once attempt to let this pass by without calling for the heads of people?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: I agree that terms like Australian Formula 1 need an explanation but isn't that why we link the term to the Australian Formula 1 page? Do we need to disrupt the flow of the article to explain a term which is already explained on the linked page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: According to <url>, links are permissible as part of your signature but be sure to check the \"'''Sign my name exactly as shown'''\" box.  What happens when you load '''<nowiki><url><url> (<url>)</nowiki>''' into the signature window and check the box?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: OK you're right- I guess IPs can't do it. I believe they're all fixed now, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: Thanks for your additional categorizing. :) I guess I could just look at your contributions, but before catting, what \"work\" were you doing previously?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 9:\nText: Great job. Will it be done by next week?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: Are you talking about that I noticed that <url> wasn't in <url> even though <person> was changed to use <person> on 6 October 2010? And then did some script-assisted editing to remove <url> from a bunch of pages that had both the category and <person>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: I state what I see when I read it.  Are you and <url> the same editor?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: I wondered, simply because I see you occasionally and had never seen him before, so at first I thought he was you.  I wonder if there's a User:Nyttned running around?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 13:\nText: Was working, so no. You?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 14:\nText: He's taken the notice down.  Doesn't this count as belaboring the point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: I asked some questions in the Criteria for Inclusion section on 20th Dec but no-one has yet responded. Can you take a look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 16:\nText: Oh, that's because I only copyedited a tiny section of the article. Should I still count that as a yes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 17:\nText: Point taken. Would you like to be a mod?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: I am sorry, got confused on who created this article. :-/ Apologies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 19:\nText: Sounds good then.  In this case, would it be wise to simply remove the \"influence\" field since it simply overlaps with \"subjects\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: It already look great. BTW, what are your thoughts about the previous post on the names of the other post office and rates lists?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 21:\nText: Wikipedia has a strict rule about ''not'' simultaneously filing an article in both a parent category ''and'' a subcategory of the same parent. Could you please ''not'' add <url> to a category if it's already in <url>, <url> or a country-specific record labels category?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 22:\nText: From the edit history to the template, it appears that your last edit has not been undone so hopefully this issue is resolved. You are both editors of between 1 and 2 years experience here, so perhaps a bit better communications would be a better approach in future?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: I've conceded on the infobox issue, but there are still some other outstanding issues, which I've addressed on the article talk page. Perhaps you would like to comment there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: Okay, I asked for help at <url>, was directed to <url>. What do you want to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Hey. I'm proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 26:\nText: I have your CH2.js installed, but I forgot what it does.  What does it do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: I made a change to your user page. Is that the change you wanted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 28:\nText: What the hell? Bitter much?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 29:\nText: I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information. Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: Did make me smile....a dreamtime legend of a tiger in WA of all places. Seems a long way to walk, even when there was a land bridge ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Good day, sorry to bother you. Is the 2:00 am news brief called eyewitness news everynite, and if it is do they play move closer to your world?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
