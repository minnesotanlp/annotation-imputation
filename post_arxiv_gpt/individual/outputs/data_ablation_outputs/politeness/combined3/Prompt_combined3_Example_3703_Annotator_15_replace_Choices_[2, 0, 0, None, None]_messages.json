I seem to remember there was some issue years ago with a rock group of the same name, but don't you look at these things before you delete?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 2:\nText: I seem to have adopted this article, since country music and dance are interests of mine. Can you recommend an easy to use bot that would help me in keeping those unwanted links out of the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 3:\nText: I put plural women because in the storylines it states he falls for Detective Graves. He also hits on another older woman <url> but that wasn't notable enough to include.. is it best to keep it singular?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 4:\nText: This is a really sore subject, because most of parents of kids with learning difficulties dont agree with the term \"retardation\" - it is unscientific and also quite abusive. Could you please delete the category or rename it \"learning disability organisations ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi again. How do you become an administrator?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: <url> and <url> are both accounts which have vandalised the article, and both have been created solely for vandalism. I believe they're one and the same; do you know an admin that can take action?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: I can't remember if I asked/checked to see if it got to you? So... did it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: Is the caption \"Steelhead trout has been said to exist in Aliso Creek...\" grammatically correct?  Should it be \"have been\", referring to the trout as a group?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 9:\nText: pls see my comments on your revert on the talk page.  Perhaps you'll consider undoing my revert?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 10:\nText: I'm surprised no one has seen my sneaky joke category addition. Can I put <url> in there as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: You're a math teacher, right?  May I ask what grade level?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 12:\nText: In <url>, people seemed to agree with you, but I just don't understand your proposal. So, what exactly do you mean in terms of category renaming/merging/recategorization?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: <url>. What do you think should be done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: It's probably not notable, but it was already <url> once. Perhaps a selective merge to <url> might be an idea?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 15:\nText: I don't get it, Tintor2. Why do you think Sephiroth is not <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: I see you deleted this page a while back as an attack page.  Any chance that the information originally had anything to do with the John Lamb mentioned in <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 17:\nText: Everything about <url> looks fantastic, but.. going to |2 instead of |30em seems like a major step back. Is there a reason for it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Hi, you removed links from \"Microscope image processing\" which I just added to resources which contain information on digital microsocopy. How to define their (ir-)relevance and justify their validity (or not) for inclusion/exclusion on this page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 19:\nText: Why tag for deletion? It was obviously a new user's attempt at creating a disambiguation page, why not clean it up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 20:\nText: Hey, can you block this moron from editing the IIHF Page? Or what can i do in such cases?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 21:\nText: I reverted <url> as it complicated my normal routine archiving of all the discussions on my talk page.  Could you please refrain from this kind of edit in future?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: The layout is there and also some content but due to lack of time during the recent past I was unable to bring it to the final 'publication suitable' form. Perhaps you could help me in giving the final touches?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 23:\nText: Hi, Wereon - I'm afraid I'm rather amateur at nominating articles for deletion. Where do I start?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 24:\nText: Hi, I wanted to ask what do you follow to create redirects on this <url>??\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 25:\nText: I think the <url> would be more precise and accurate as <url>. What sayest thou?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 26:\nText: Martin, sorry to disturb you, but you said that Kelson is making the new ZIM file, where is the location of that file?

Can you edit freely now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 2:\nText: I found <url> while working <url> from <url>, my first impulse was to give it a prod, an long unreferenced orphan without a clear reason to exist.  I see you are still active on Wikipedia, is there chance you can do something for this article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 3:\nText: In retrospect \"in as far away as\" looks ungrammatical. Shouldn't it just be \"as far away as\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hey, so your move of this, and wanted to point out that the reason I put a disambig title on it, was because there are two different labor unions of the same name, either one of which could wind up with an article. But, I don't know that that means the article should automatically get the title, is there a standard for this situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \"naming\" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: In your most recent edit to <url> you stated that the track in Clermont, Florida does not fulfill IAAF regulations (since reverted by another editor).

Would you like me to run one or both of them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 8:\nText: Yeah I'd be happy to look at the list, however can't promise much! Shall we discuss it on the article's talk page so that any comments are in the relevent place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 9:\nText: I thought that only section tags go into sections while the article tags go to the top of the page so they could serve it's purpose. Is there a Wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: Hi.  Is there anything I can do to help you utilize the spell check features of your browser?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 12:\nText: You may not remember doing this but, you erased a page entitled, Earl Newton.  Why did you do it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: I think I do mark my pages patrolled. Doesn't Twinkle do it automatically?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: Your bot takes zh:u514bu91ccu65afu6258u5f17xb7u6885u7b56u723eu5fb7 off of the Christoph Metzelder page. What exactly is wrong with it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 15:\nText: Is this something that is needed, even though most of the links are still alive?

Malcolm Greany's ''Ansel Adams and Camera'' on the basis that the latter image is in the public domain. How did you determine that this image is a work of the U.S. government?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 17:\nText: Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don't (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 18:\nText: I'm confused: what did you do?  And how did you delete it twice without restoring it in between?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 19:\nText: Thanks, the logo looks much better now. You wouldn't have a logo for the two predessesor clubs by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 20:\nText: Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: I noticed that you changed the formatting for <url> slightly, putting the links to 18-crown-6 and en to the sentence after the chemical structure rather than in the chemical structure itself. Why is that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 22:\nText: After <url> <url>, all/most of the needs specified have been completed. Do you think its worth re-nominating <url> for FA or GA status?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 23:\nText: And <url> targets <url>. Shouldn't it go to <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 24:\nText: '''Question''' to both of you.  Would it be considered canvassing to notify every participant of the AfD of the discussion at <url> and ask for their input?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 25:\nText: Did you mean to also remove the Breitbart reference from the \"Incidents\" section?  Have I missed a meeting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: This deleted page was recreated. Since you were the original nom., is this basically the same article, or has it been improved?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: You deleted Ricardo Marinello. What was written in the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 28:\nText: ''You wrote:'' I'm not trying to be obtuse, but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn't apply because the assertion of notability has been made?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 29:\nText: Jvhertum, Last year you made this change :http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Split-Second&action=historysubmit&diff=343316267&oldid=343252107 to the <url> article with the justification that \"A is part of the name\". This does not appear to be a valid reason to exclude it (<url> has a DEFAULTSORT of Beatles despite 'The' being part of the name), your thoughts ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: There are a few posts at <url> saying people are having trouble seeing the DYK picture that's up now. Do you think you could switch it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: In this <url> there was a loss of some info.  Was that intentional?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
