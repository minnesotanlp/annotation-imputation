Text: No-one's saying you can't edit anything, but what we are saying is that introducing grammatically incorrect phrases, POV, weasel words and things discussed and discounted in the numerous PRs and FLCs this article went through is inappropriate.

Text: I couldn't find your "email user" function. What's up?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 16:
Text: He used it to assert that '''''others''''' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 18:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 24:
Text: You are just saying that <math>frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</math> is continuous at <math>h=0</math>, but that is not the same as saying <math>f'(x)</math> is continuous. Do you have any references?

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 2:
Text: But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''<url>'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom?

Example 3:
Text: When we have a GLAM barnstar then you get it ..... just for the Hindi article! I cannot explain why you needed to create a Derby page in Hindi - surely it should be there already?

Annotation from annotator: 4

Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 10:
Text: I think a separate security section heading is required in <url> article as it gets prime billing in the introduction, but then has references (and criticisms) scattered throughout the rest of the article.  Do you support this?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 11:
Text: See <url>. I've made them, can you help fill them out and place them in the articles?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 12:
Text: Ok.  By the way, may I note that is an excellent resource you have there.   I noticed the other day that we had acquired a list at <url> of unproduced scripts/stories - it seems entirely genuine and fits with material I have read elsewhere but was uncited - I wonder if you could help find a source for it?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 13:
Text: I don't think I've used it in Wikipedia.  So, if I haven't, why did you bring it up?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 14:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Text: Somewhat related, shouldn't <url>, be renamed to <url>? I realize that Baha'i forbids sectarianism, but this is what the article is about, no?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 20:
Text: Ah, I was confused by the fact that your tag was placed on <url>, not on <url>.  Wildbot has visited, & updated the talk page again, so where is the result of the whole exercise?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Text: I see you've added <url> to the category "Jewish-Canadians".  What is your source for this?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 25:
