Did you really need to send me a reminder?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 3:\nText: Good! By the way, what do you think of merging the recurring animals in <url> to <url> and then getting rid of the rest?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: It looks like you have done considerable work on <url>.  Could you add at least some references to the article in keeping with <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 5:\nText: Thanks, but I believe I've covered the sustance. Could you also get Beeblebrox to strike the \"Mr\" insult, unless he was doing it deliberately?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 6:\nText: Thank You. What is \"The Prince of Santorini\" anyway?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 7:\nText: You just added it again. Maybe you should look over the guidelines for inclusion of the tag?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 8:\nText: Sure thing, and thank you for noticing! Is the colour better now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 9:\nText: How about Guant who plays Pansy?

You?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 11:\nText: So the nomination was made by your sock. Could you explain why you choose to use a sock?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 12:\nText: Thanks. As for the previous edits, should I make a note on the User Page that it's my account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: I see you removed the review, which makes sense until at least four days from now, when it won't be mentioned on the mainpage at all. But maybe leave a note at <url> so he doesn't feel put-off?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 14:\nText: I personally don't think templates such as that are that good but this template connects a lot of different categories and articles together to try to grasp a huge subject . Have I made my idea clear?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: It's on the talkpage - you are deleting like crazy. I can ask for a Cabral if you like?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 16:\nText: I create <url>, and then I would click \"Move\" on the top of the page I want to merge (for example <url>? Is that how you do it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 17:\nText: Do you really believe that your photograph at the top of the <url> is better than my photograph which you removed? Should Wikipedia have a dedicated sunrise article that does not feature even one single decent image of a red sky?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 18:\nText: Thank you for that, I was having a problem with diffs and the explanation didn't make sense to me. This is the first I have had to do, what is the procedure?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 19:\nText: What's the best way to take this up? I can't remove it from him as I'm involved, ANI?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: How can a permablocked user edit? And who would set up a sockpuppet months in advance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: Hi. How do you think, is <url> of FL quality?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: Eight more articles semi-protected. How many of these damned T & J articles are there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 23:\nText: I'm not sure I understand what this has to do with what I said.  Could you restate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 24:\nText: Did you upload ''Image:1111.jpg'' to make a point about censorship? What exactly is your intention with that image?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: So even though the article says that there are 16 primitive Pythagorean triples with c < 100 there are actually 32??\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: The <url> has several pictures uploaded by you with no source or license information. I'd like to feature this article on the main page - could you please add this information before that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 27:\nText: There's a vote at <url> to reinstate as the primary topic after a move from <url>. Have an opinion to share?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 28:\nText: By the way, see the comments by Carlaude on my talk page re: holding off on the AD ones. I was under the impression he only needed a few days delay, but now he mentioned another week or longer?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 29:\nText: Blocking people who disagree with your edits is a very zionist approach. Why don't you try instead to justify why your material should stay in the lead?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 30:\nText: Hi Khoikhoi - I see you deleted a previous incarnation of a pan-Arabism article which seems to be resurfacing under variant names, and is now at <url>. This doesn't read to me like an encyclopedia article - do you have any thoughts on whether/under what criterion it should be deleted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Awesome! What was I doing wrong in the Italian films?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: I had a quick scan through the <url> article, which while good seems to be to suffer from the negative effects of \"summary style\" when used on very large topics - namely that while the individual sections are good summaries of what they are describing, the ''overall'' article lacks a coherent flow, a narrative taking the reader from beginning to end. Does that make sense?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: No problem, It was open and shut <url> issue. For your next project can you find something that doesnt make your fanclub at the Wikipedia Review angry?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hey, if you took this picture you can release it into the public domain. If not, do you know who took it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: Xandar, this Elizabeth II RFC represents the form of RFC I would like to use for the Catholic Church article. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 6:\nText: Forgive me if you've already done this, but...Could you post a list of the listing codes (such as DO, RN, etc.) for possibly non-listed properties with reference numbers?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: I've never played the RPG. What more information does it provide about Argos, Atlas, Julie, Ron, and the FISS Metas?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: Btw, I've issued a request for discussion on the Canadian Wikipedians' notice board about a dispute involving myself and another contributor on <url>. If you have a chance, could you look this over?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: Firstly, why do you assume I don't care about the content, and secondly, what chance have you given anyone to voice a dissenting opinion? Correct me if I am wrong, but you don't seem to have asked if anyone had a problem with the merge, did you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 10:\nText: The only books by Paul I was able to find were ''Concordia the Lutheran Confessions: A Readers Edition of the Book of Concord'' (Hardcover  - not yet released) and ''Communion fellowship: A resource for understanding, implementing, and retaining the practice of closed communion in the Lutheran parish'' (Unknown Binding - Jan 1, 1992).  Are those his scholarly works?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 11:\nText: Problem is how do you recognise the categories, as there are thousands of them. I have already made a program that scans the database, and can locate the unstubbed articles, so finding the untagged stubs is ok, and AWB automatically adds the stub tag if the article is short, I just can't think how you could program it to automatically guess the type of stub, any ideas?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: I'm also having to use your link.  Perhaps we should change the main page link to use the megaupload until we know that the main website is up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 13:\nText: Secondly, please show me where Maynard Smith credits this idea to Haldane.  Have you read the Grafen paper?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Thanks for the detailed reply.  Can a random admin who notices the image with the speedy tag do something useful to fix the situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thank you for telling me. Can you please revert my deletion, for I do not yet know how to do so?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 16:\nText: lol, turns out the photo isn't his either. Any ideas from here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hi Gareth. I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction for learning about building a wikipedia profile?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Wow, you waited a whole ten minutes. What's the problem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 19:\nText: I do not, nor have I ever used other accounts on Wikipedia. Didn't you ask me this before?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 20:\nText: At first I couldn't see it, but now that I've taken a closer look I see what you mean.  Now, I wonder, who was the first most decorated PR soldier in WW II?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: No problem.  :) Did you see the additional notes on the project talk page about the rest of those books from the 70s?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 22:\nText: As I said in the summary when moving him away from <url>, for the last twenty-six years of his life he wasn't a priest. Perhaps I've missed the part of the naming convention which requires 'priest', could you please say more?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 23:\nText: Anytime. How do you like this closer crop?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 24:\nText: Did you discuss it with the user? Did you ask him/her to redact or remove it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 25:\nText: That explains some things, guess this'll take getting used to (not to mention the dozens of dabs I have to go back and re-fix). So, do you recall <url> by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: I'm going to remove it. Is that okay with you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: If it can wait until tomorrow, I'll look then. Could you provide diffs to the two threads?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 28:\nText: At the top of the page it characterizes a guideline as ''a generally accepted standard that editors should follow'' along with a passing reference to <url>. So, I might ask, how would using 4 tildes prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: As I have said before, it is an issue of breadth vs. depth. Are you familiar with such concepts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 30:\nText: Thank you for your answer. What are the sources for region 4 (Australia) release dates?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I wish I could say, but I don't know what it is.  Could you tell me a little more?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
