Who is he?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: Hi Skully, I've been keeping an eye on your edits over the past few weeks, and I think you should be a admin. Is it alright if I nominated you to be an admin?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 3:\nText: You may want to comment on the A7 to ?2 graph with 4 lines. I suspect it is nonsense - but what are your thoughts on that folding option?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 4:\nText: Was working, so no. You?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 5:\nText: Gosh, I didn't realise it was so many. Would that include 20 batches of DYK hooks (totalling 100 total hooks)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 6:\nText: I'm sorry, but there is no discussion on the talk page that indicates that there was a debate about renaming, so the keep vote stands, I'm afraid.  There were nine votes to keep, and only one to merge, so I don't understand how a single vote trumps nine others?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 7:\nText: I created the redirect page \"SEAC (computer)\" and I think the article chould go there, with redirects from the other two names.  Since you are an administrator, can you do that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm not sure if you've changed your opinion of the article's FAC status, but I think you have guided us in a ton of good ideas.  Have you changed your opinion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: I've been going through <url> and replacing the FiveHorizons.com refs (per Quadzilla99's comments). However, refs 39 and 40 don't seem to appear anywhere else; could you perhaps replace them with more reliable sources if you get the chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 10:\nText: \"''Images with iconic status or historical importance: As subjects of commentary.''\". Listen, it's just trivial to look up, could you take the care of actually reading these policies before arguing over them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 11:\nText: And can you point me to a statement of that company where they say that they release their images into the <url>? Or can you provide proof that their copyright has expired?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: While editing the COIN page regarding Ciplex, I accidently broke your sig. Since I don't want any more flame, could you please fix it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 13:\nText: Wanted to Email you about Wikimedia Converence Netherlands, but your email is not working. In any case, you could crash at our place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 14:\nText: Shane I reverted the edit you made this moring <url> but on second thought I would like some advice.  Is it implied in stub that they do not have references or is it appropriate to mark stubs as requiring a reference?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 15:\nText: I am not sure what are rules about GA in en.wiki but for me <url> is really outdated and it shouldn`t have GA sign. What you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: That sounds like they are just \"general use\" of the word, so in each article delink and (if needed) explain that, in this context, diaphragm means a divider - or just rewrite without the word diaphragm, or use a link to wiktionary. In fact, should linking to wiktionary be a standard way to clear up some of the links to dab pages?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: I just reverted your edits to the <url> page, because you seemed to make a number of major changes without providing an explanation for them, except the word 'Infobox' in your edit summary. Can you provide any references for the changes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 18:\nText: Oh, it's not that big of a deal. Drew, which IP edit did you consider to be \"attacking\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 19:\nText: I have addressed many of the points that you had brought up at the FAC, as well as many of the comments from other editors, some of whom have changed their sentiment recently to \"Support\".  Perhaps you could reevaluate your stance on the article, and see if you feel you could change your position in the current FAC?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: Take a look at the most recent post to <url>. Can you make a stub out of it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: M, I think we should put back the section that was archived yesterday. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 22:\nText: Indeed, the New York Times tells us that Iain Hook \"''was shot in the back by an Israeli soldier ''\". Why did a member of the IDF shoot him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 23:\nText: What is your opinion on just having that page deleted?  The spelling differences between that and <url> are more than minimal, as there are 4 differences between the two?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 24:\nText: What can you say about <url>, some of them are marked as stubs. Is it correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Latest version (now on  Commons); all placenames included but still needs some tidying up and  tweaking. Comments?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 26:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 27:\nText: As a rough look over, the splits look ok to me (although yes, more discussion before forking is generally a good thing). If you think there are serious problems with them, why not just address it on the talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 28:\nText: I've had a look at it...I cannot make the height/width of the image any smaller because it will limit the number of towns I can add.  Therefore, is there any point to adding an atlas to wikipedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 29:\nText: Done. Does Adam Hunter need your disambig-style touch?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 30:\nText: Where is the exception in <url> for \"tossing out citations and verifiable in order to make it easier for the reader\"?  Who are you to disagree with Nikon's label of \"Compact Professional\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nHuman-Rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Okay. But in that case, shouldn't the meanings \"of\" and \"from\" from some languages be removed from the article as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 2:\nText: Also, If we replace the maps with an image of a monument, then we could eliminate the architecture part. It would also make the article look colourful.Opinions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: I think it is important to note that Spirit 03 was the last gunship to be brought down and that it has not been involved in a Class A mishap since that date. Should we include that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 4:\nText: You said you were promoting them, but, um... they aren't listed at <url>, they still say they're FPOCs on their talk pages, etc, etc. Should we consider them featured or not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 5:\nText: Finally, I checked with articles Plastid, Mitochondria and Mitochondrial genome, and see they all use the term 'genome', and that there is no suggestion that they have 'chromosomes'. So may we at least get rid of that usage on the Chromosome article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: Sure, but what's the deal with fair use and cropping?  I thought the Zatanna one got removed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 7:\nText: What are they? Where did that offensive photo come from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 8:\nText: You added to the Order of Victoria and Albert page that no awards were given out after the death of Queen Victoria.  According to the <url> she became the tSovereign of the Order in 1952.  Is this just because the order was never officially scrapped ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks for your assistance in the review of the Brian Keith review at the DYK! The user has cited the Internet Movie Database before?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 10:\nText: I posted here rather than to Jon's page because I don't want to embarrass the students; I know Jon watchlists your page and I am sure other NRG editors do too.  Anyway, what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: I wasn't aware my statement was supposed to cause worry.  Is there something I'm missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 12:\nText: You make it very hard to believe that you're acting in good faith when you rewrite the <url> article to remove all references to \"liberal,\" but keep the phrase \"conservative Independence Institute.\"  I see POV-pushing when that happens.  If you're so concerned about adjectives, why not edit the articles about AEI or Heritage or Americans for Tax Reform?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 13:\nText: - This IP has been doing the same to me. There seems to be a remarkable similarity with <url>, could this be a case of sockpuppeting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hi, thanks for letting me know about my signature not being linked. I tried to save the settings in preferences - did it work?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 15:\nText: Ron - I'm interested in your edit comment here <url>. Your position is that RC is a sufficiently reliable source that anything it mentions is automatically notable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 16:\nText: The history section appears to be copied and pasted directly from somewhere. Is this a copyvio issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 17:\nText: I am puzzled that you just deleted the file 'harry potter stamps'. This file seems to have existed for two years without deletion, so perhaps you could explain the grounds for speedy deletion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: What are the numbers <url>? Are they population figures?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 19:\nText: Anyway, if you feel that strongly about it we should at least add a summary. Whats you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 20:\nText: Hey,saw you had a page in the works in your sandbox. Are you planning to move it to mainspace soon?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: Notwithstanding the caption, my understanding is that because of the time since the first publication of the photo, the copyright has expired and Iu2019m free scan the figure and upload the image to Wikipedia. Is this correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 22:\nText: Can I use a manga image colored by myself? There won't be any problems with the lisense, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: <url>. Can you tell me if this date is for the arcade or Wii version?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 24:\nText: I noticed your warning on <url>, this guy has been vandalizing another old cartoon article as well, how can we put a stop to this? Is there a way to tag the IPs (there are 2) so a mod will stop them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 25:\nText: Among the measures you described, it sounds as if the next thing to try is option-command-start and rebuild the desktop. Does rebuilding the desktop mean I'd get a blank and have to restore all the icons?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: Thanks for the heads up. He doesn't know any english?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 27:\nText: He Colfer, just to let you know I changed the headings in name (I think we should avoid making diaries, but order based on activities), but kept (hopefully) the spirit of your changes in tact. How does it look to you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 28:\nText: ...for reverting '''Image:Wpixcw11-1.jpg''' back from the previous incorrect logo uploaded by <url>.  I had tried, but how did you do it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: Thanks for the tip.  How come I sometimes come across pages where the trailing 's' is left off (or am I confusing that with the 's situation)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 30:\nText: I notice that to the <url> and <url> pages edited '''''Gorka''''' '''Josxe9 Unda Velasco''' and changed it to simply ''Gorka''. Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 2\n\nTarget Example:\nText: <url>  Honestly, I'd like to know if you really are defending <url>.  Do you really believe that they were justified?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
