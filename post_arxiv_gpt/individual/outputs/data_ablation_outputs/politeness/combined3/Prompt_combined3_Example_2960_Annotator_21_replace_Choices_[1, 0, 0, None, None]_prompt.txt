Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 2:
Text: At the top of the page it characterizes a guideline as ''a generally accepted standard that editors should follow'' along with a passing reference to <url>. So, I might ask, how would using 4 tildes prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 3:
Text: And now you undid my declination of that one which was copyrighted. Would you ''please'' quit undoing my declinations?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 4:
Text: I've just noticed I wrote "It's possibly the most ''possible'' incident in his life" for "possibly the most ''important''", so I may be more caught in the toils of flu than I thought. Check I haven't done anything stupid, and smooth out the text?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Text: Who???
Annotation from annotator: 8

Annotation from annotator: 12

Text: Yeah, I agree. What's up with that?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 8

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 16:
Text: I see you've added <url> to the category "Jewish-Canadians".  What is your source for this?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:
Text: Some of his categories seem rather POV to me, and it's rather obvious from his AfD participation that there's a disruptive streak afoot. Since you've got a bit of knowledge in the area, do they seem like the kinds of things which should be deleted?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 18:

Annotation from annotator: 12
