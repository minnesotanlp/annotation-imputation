Estimated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: Hi, do you mind if I move your hook to go live on 26/27th? The GLAM WIKI conference could do with being highlighed by a non US/UK hook?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 2:
Text: Thanks terribly for looking it up. Would it be alright for me to use the new source in Europe, economy section then?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 3:
Text: Hey, I just tried to link to Marat Ayin and it came up as a red link. Do you know if we have an article on it and I'm just not using the right transliteration or do we really not have an article?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 4:
Text: Are you really denying that you brought Giano and Bishonen's names into this? Seriously?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: The admin says he thinks it should be renamed, but someone else is trying to pull the "but it happened in the same area nonsense". Was I clear enough in explaining where the pictures are listed?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 6:
Text: You lost me J. I did the edits because I remember you telling me that repeating things that are already in the wiki-link is unneeded and/or redundant. Do you not recall that instance?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 7:
Text: Help how? Do you mean disambiguating links like this:<url>?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 8:
Text: But the main question was that would it be a bad idea to make more articles about characters, orginizations and etc. in a book?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 9:
Text: I'm with you - it really is a friggin' pain that people refuse to read no matter how big you put the text.  Should we just maybe remove the source entirely?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 10:
Text: I apologize if I have misunderstood.  Are you not an acknowledged devotee of Prem Rawat?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 11:
Text: WHADDAFUCK YA GONNA DO TO ME, HUH BITCH!?????????
Annotation from annotator: 0

Example 12:
Text: AnonEMouse, I have noticed today that there are many recent comments on the <url> talk page that do not show in "history". How can that happen?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 13:
Text: Especially considering that it took you ''a lot'' more time to vandalize the page than the two seconds it took us to fix it. What's the point?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 14:
Text: I'm glad you made things calculate automatically (and I trust you've tested it!). Shouldn't we update the <url> to not show the unneeded variables, then?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 15:
Text: I looked at all the provinces and regencies listed on <url> - so that trick is mostly played out. I'm going down the alphabet now and I'm at the R's - if you want to work, maybe you could start at the end of the alphabet so we don't interfere with each other, meet in the middle?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 16:
Text: I don't see the references anywhere. Do you mean the "glimcher website" and "official website" links?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:
Text: It is disputed among admins regarding the protection of userpages, although the policy says that users can have their user/user sub-pages (but not the talks) semi-protected if the user requests it. Are there other subpages of yours that you'd like protecting?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 18:
Text: It just doesn't make sense (to me) that we use a manga spelling for one name but a Simmons' spelling for another. Can't we just go along with Simmons on this one?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 19:
Text: Well, lyrics are generally frowned upon on Wikipedia, unless the song is old enough that its copyright no longer applies. Could you perhaps link to the article?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 20:
Text: Halfling may be another name for Hobbit, but the model for the Hobbit encouraged the creation of other Halflings. Nevertheless it is a Halfling, is it not?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 22:
Text: I couldn't find your "email user" function. What's up?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 27:
Text: What is your objection?  Would a split address your concerns?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 28:
Text: That's a <url>-length rant. Still, be nice and AGF, okay?

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 30:
Text: I believe it was I who moved it, based on what appeared to be consensus to use the hyphen in that context.  Where is this guideline of which you speak that suggests otherwise?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Text: Still doing vandalism reverts by hand I see. Need any help?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 2:
Text: Indeed, the New York Times tells us that Iain Hook "''was shot in the back by an Israeli soldier ''". Why did a member of the IDF shoot him?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 3:
Text: I don't think so, Giano. Can we just once attempt to let this pass by without calling for the heads of people?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 4:
Text: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 5:
Text: I agree that terms like Australian Formula 1 need an explanation but isn't that why we link the term to the Australian Formula 1 page? Do we need to disrupt the flow of the article to explain a term which is already explained on the linked page?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 6:
Text: According to <url>, links are permissible as part of your signature but be sure to check the "'''Sign my name exactly as shown'''" box.  What happens when you load '''<nowiki><url><url> (<url>)</nowiki>''' into the signature window and check the box?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 7:
Text: OK you're right- I guess IPs can't do it. I believe they're all fixed now, right?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 8:
Text: Thanks for your additional categorizing. :) I guess I could just look at your contributions, but before catting, what "work" were you doing previously?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 9:
Text: Great job. Will it be done by next week?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 10:
Text: Are you talking about that I noticed that <url> wasn't in <url> even though <person> was changed to use <person> on 6 October 2010? And then did some script-assisted editing to remove <url> from a bunch of pages that had both the category and <person>?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 11:
Text: I state what I see when I read it.  Are you and <url> the same editor?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 12:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 13:
Text: Was working, so no. You?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 14:
Text: He's taken the notice down.  Doesn't this count as belaboring the point?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 15:
Text: I asked some questions in the Criteria for Inclusion section on 20th Dec but no-one has yet responded. Can you take a look?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 16:
Text: Oh, that's because I only copyedited a tiny section of the article. Should I still count that as a yes?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 17:
Text: Point taken. Would you like to be a mod?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 18:
Text: I am sorry, got confused on who created this article. :-/ Apologies?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 19:
Text: Sounds good then.  In this case, would it be wise to simply remove the "influence" field since it simply overlaps with "subjects"?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Text: It already look great. BTW, what are your thoughts about the previous post on the names of the other post office and rates lists?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 21:
Text: Wikipedia has a strict rule about ''not'' simultaneously filing an article in both a parent category ''and'' a subcategory of the same parent. Could you please ''not'' add <url> to a category if it's already in <url>, <url> or a country-specific record labels category?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 22:
Text: From the edit history to the template, it appears that your last edit has not been undone so hopefully this issue is resolved. You are both editors of between 1 and 2 years experience here, so perhaps a bit better communications would be a better approach in future?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 23:
Text: I've conceded on the infobox issue, but there are still some other outstanding issues, which I've addressed on the article talk page. Perhaps you would like to comment there?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 28:
Text: What the hell? Bitter much?
Annotation from annotator: 0

Example 29:
Text: I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information. Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 30:
Text: Did make me smile....a dreamtime legend of a tiger in WA of all places. Seems a long way to walk, even when there was a land bridge ?
