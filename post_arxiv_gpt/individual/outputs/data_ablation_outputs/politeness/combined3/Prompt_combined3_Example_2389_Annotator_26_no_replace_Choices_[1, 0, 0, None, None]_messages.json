How did this ever get to DYK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: Without participating in talk page discussion, you have deleted reliable sources, and rewritten a sentence so that it is supported by no sources at all except your personal opinion.<url>  Am I missing something here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 3:\nText: The article <url> is vandalism. Could you please delete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 4:\nText: Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I'm having a bad night, and all the theading... anyway, did I get them all?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: I guess there's a connection to <url> too. Do you think that's cu worthy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: COI? What COI do you think I have?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: You seemed, to me, to be addressing all of us who were opposed to your merger. Do you know a different meaning for \"oddwater\" other than \"urine\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hi, just noticed you reverted this page back to its pre-COPYVIO state.  Any reason you didn't use the content at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks; it just occurred to me to cite USGS maps, but this is maybe even better.  Was there once an airplane crash in the vicinity, or are there maps like this for all parts of the country?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 10:\nText: Thanks. Do you feel the information is \"weak\" or is it just too complex?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 11:\nText: Thanks terribly for looking it up. Would it be alright for me to use the new source in Europe, economy section then?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hi Awadewit,  I hope I've started a discussion at <url>?  Would you like to weigh in there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 13:\nText: Did you see JzG <url> James Cantor that his alleged COI prohibits him from editing any BLPs related to his academic field?  Didn't the AN discussion after the last round actually repudiate JzG's stance on this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 14:\nText: Since your tube station articles don't actually contain any information, what is the point of them? Why not put them together and work them into an article that says something interesting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 15:\nText: True, and you're right. But it does define it, so doesn't that mean it shouldn't have a comma?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 16:\nText: I had no idea that I was such a rogue admin. Are you seriously suggesting that I need to be kicked off the project for closing a deletion debate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Useful image indeed. Do you happen to have a source to add to the powergrid image, so we can use it in the articles as a verified thing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 19:\nText: I note that you have redirected the latter article (3,500+ characters, edit history back to Nov 2008, half a dozen references) to the former (650 characters, created today - by you, one reference). Is there a discussion/consensus for that move, and are you going to be incorporating much of the redirected articles content into the current one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: I'm sure you're right but I can't find it in FM and haven't found it anywhere else. Could you cite sources in the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: <url>  Honestly, I'd like to know if you really are defending <url>.  Do you really believe that they were justified?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 22:\nText: no problem. ic an hit it up through preferences seciton, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: I'm no expert on the language, but on the face of it that dab page disambiguates two words which are unambiguous anyway - Zakhmet and Khachpas. Am I missing something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to do that <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Lionel, tell me the truth.  How long have you known BelloMello was wMo?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: I note that you've edited since this was brought up here. Could you please respond?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: Also - for some reason images on image pages now appear in full size when I view them, rather than more convienient viewing sizes. Do you know how I can fix this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: I suppose I should not have used rollback. I was aware of the problem, but you had not solved it, had you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 29:\nText: When you deleted <url> did you accidentally overlook the <person> template? Or do you have some reason for ignoring it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 30:\nText: As I've only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut-and-paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly.  Was db-1 the right tag for <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Thank you for telling me. Can you please revert my deletion, for I do not yet know how to do so?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 2:\nText: But I don't know anything about central europe. Have you tried the normal dispute resolution avenues?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hmm, well I'll see before judging.  Does it also allow them to be listed from newest-to-oldest and separated into Russian and English references?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: I'm not sure I understand what this has to do with what I said.  Could you restate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi, I found two sources which state that <url> was still married and when she moved to Harlem with her Husband. Do you have any sources to the contrary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: Okay, I will be glad to help you here! Could you please list the username you would want now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Miten sxe4 osaat nii hyvin suomee jos sun xe4idinkieli on kumminki englanti? Onks sul suomenkieliset vanhemmat tai jotai vai ootsxe4 vaa opiskellu ite tosi paljo suomee?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: Yes, and there has been a user from an AOL IP who has been trolling Pilotguy for weeks. Why must you blindly disagree with everything anyone says to you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: I give that a huge second. Why haven't you signed onto the wikiproject yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 11:\nText: Stephen's solution certainly isn't optimal. Fancy giving me a basic rundown on the problem here and I'll see if I can devise a more elegant one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: <url> has a discussion (well kinda right now, I'm still waiting for the initiator to actually explain himself) about the fair use strength of images on episode lists (why there and not on <url>'s talk page is beyond me.  Care to chime in?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 13:\nText: I don't understand why Hong is so reluctant to revert unilateral changes from time-to-time when he did so frequently in the past when I or someone else who supported my edits did it. What exactly is the point in me agreeing to this if someone conveniently comes along and then starts making lots of changes that I don't like but Giovanni doesn't mind?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 14:\nText: You're a troll. Why not go somewhere else?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 15:\nText: eh, i've ALWAYS hated 50 meter pools (200 butterfly was always the BIGGEST pain in the ass) although i really did like butterfly for some reason.... never quite got that, so was it an indoor or outdoor pool????\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 16:\nText: You are talking about direktor, right? He begin the edit war again, as seen by diffs, so C was blocked instead of direktor, see?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 17:\nText: Yes, I apologize, my friend (I guess I have some kind of a phobia that you will forget about my posts :) ) I will wait as long as you want me to. Could you read Mir Harven's posts on talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: SPI is not for just simple yes no answers. Why did you not warn the Minneapolis IP, they are warring as much as Bb23?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 19:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: The links were removed but, what rule says it is best to \"double space\"? And what do you plan to rewrite exactly?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 21:\nText: No problem, done. What's your connection to Casey?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 22:\nText: Thank you very much for your kind comments but I don't recall if or when I made these contributions. Are you sure it was me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 23:\nText: Thanks a lot for clearing that up. Do you also happen to know about the age of consent in Thailand, and why he could be charge with child sex offenses even though she was 17 years old?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 24:\nText: It may very well have been a better candidate for a stub rather than a speedy deletion. I would rather not talk about this on another users talk page, if you would like to discuss if further could we continue any further posts on <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Is there any way I could talk you into being more conservative with creation of new articles?  Do you agree that some of what you're creating here would be seen as obviously deletable material by most editors?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: The above username has been indefinitely banned as a phishing account. Now why would they want my login details...?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: Thanks. Oh, and if you don't mind, would you please block the sockmaster?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 28:\nText: Oh I know, but I think that's a ''problem''. Unless there is some other cat for modem companies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 29:\nText: See: <url>. If I remember correctly, you said you planned on cleaning up after the bot tagged the images; is that still the case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 30:\nText: I've deleted the old versions of ''Winnie the Pooh'' and ''Prom'', but I haven't deleted the other two yet: on the ''Elite Force'' image, the image you've uploaded says \"Mac\" on the box, while the description says it's for the PC; and the external link supplied for the ''127 Hours'' poster shows the original image that was here. Shouldn't these be made consistent first?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Im sorry to see that you withdrew. Maybe next time?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
