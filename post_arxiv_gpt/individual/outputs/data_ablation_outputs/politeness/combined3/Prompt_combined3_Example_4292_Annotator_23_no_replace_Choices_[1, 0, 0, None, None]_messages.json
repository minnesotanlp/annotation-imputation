You say the attacker wraps his right arm, not his right leg, don't?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 2:\nText: Did you upload ''Image:1111.jpg'' to make a point about censorship? What exactly is your intention with that image?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 3:\nText: Thank you, it's much appreciated. What do you think of the changes so far?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hey US, I added a rationale to why the project was looking to create its own criteria.  Could you take a look at it and see if it changes your mind?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 5:\nText: Why have you included the Putnam Line in the MTA infobox, when it was never operated by the MTA (excepting the Marble Hill stub, which is hardly on a par with the Hudson Line, Harlem Line, etc.)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 6:\nText: Good luck with the remaining time for your nomination. BTW: under what section on <url> do you think it should appear?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Instead of deletion, I'm considering simply redirecting Ponystars to <url>. Any objections?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 8:\nText: I saw you put images for the Kings of Bhutan and thank you. Could you find an image to use for <url> also?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: And then people could not edit it, and my signature will become very long. Plus I think the loading is negligible, comparing people with SVG flags in their signature... What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Why did you delete the article on anal stretching????\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 11:\nText: I looked at all the provinces and regencies listed on <url> - so that trick is mostly played out. I'm going down the alphabet now and I'm at the R's - if you want to work, maybe you could start at the end of the alphabet so we don't interfere with each other, meet in the middle?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: Well the only plausible explanation was that you reverted to where I removed an extraneous cat (after Homestarmy's edit) and then swapped out a template... but as you're a competent editor that just seemed odd. Is that what indeed occurred?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 13:\nText: Lowell/Lawrence Blvd leading from Lowell to the Methuen Rotary is a device from hell as well.  How many people does that short stretch of road have to kill?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 14:\nText: So argument that \"''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''\" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: My question about the truncation operation is to understand the generic algorithm for applying a ring (or un-ringing) a Dynkin node. What method (code) do you use to get the higher dimensions truncated based on the Coxeter Dynkin ringed nodes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: \"two pigeons in a row constitute a half-wave antenna at 700 MHz\" That's a pretty cool intersection of radio invisible waves seems-like-magic and real-life objects! On the other hand, did you perhaps just crack the secret for implementing <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 17:\nText: I have been watching the vote page, but I did not even see your proposal.  What were you suggesting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 18:\nText: Huh? What was that supposed to mean?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 19:\nText: As a timid Wikipedia end-user who never makes more than a rare grammatical or spelling edit, learning the history to be found on this talk page and Kate's userpage history makes me sad. Why is it that so many communities change the way they do as the size of the project they revolve around increases..?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: Out of interest (I might check) .. do you know how the Australian Bureau of statitics classes/categories Australian Aborigines/ Aboriginal Australians??\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: Cla, your partisanship is indeed fairly obvious, and pointing to one article where you've deliberately been good isn't good enough. So: if I point you to my stand against AJL, will you declare me to be non-partisan?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 22:\nText: Inch es gartsum? <url>...do you have email by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: Please see <url>. Could you help with the list on the talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: I'm confused. Why did I get a user warning relating to this article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 25:\nText: Back when the Nirvana article was a COTW (in like September I think) I started working out a \"Musical style\" section on a userpage, but never finished it. Would you like to help out with it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: Thanks for telling me. Do you just perform the rename, and I then re-create the account to take it for myself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: What would the recommended sequencing be, then?... GAR, then FAR?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: Well, I do have one question. If I were to come across a page that I would normally mark as a CSD- like copyright infringement, etc, as an admin can I just delete it or do I need to mark it CSD and ask another opinion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: That was a <url>, rather than an <url>. Is that what you intended?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 30:\nText: thank you. but, what should i do now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: wants to move from a free nation like th US to a tyrannical country like the UK. Give me an honest opinion Haunted Angel what do you yhink of him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: Don't you think you should remove the welcoming plate of cookies you left at User:Dococe page???\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hi reinyday - I've been noticing your sig on WP:CFD... this is probably something you know all about but... you do know about being able to use four tildes (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>) to sign, don't you? Or have you done some fancy trick with your signature to stop it linking back to your user page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Yobot labelled <url> as a stub, though it has <person>. Perhaps that's a dab template Yobot doesn't know about?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: The new features of Hotcat are excellent: whom do I thank for this? :-) Are you still its maintainer?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: If you are beccoming a target again do you want semi prot for a while? How much activity is it getting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: Per <url>, edits that change the meaning of an article shouldn't normally be marked as minor.  Looking at your recent contributions, I see they're all marked as minor... perhaps you've inadvertantly ticked the \"Mark all edits minor by default\" check box in the Editing tab of your user preferences?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: That is actually quite a fair percentage, less than sixty six point six percent approval and the tool is not continued. What percentage of support do think is needed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 9:\nText: I'm really very sorry, but no, I '''didn't''' know, didn't get a message saying that was wrong. Where was it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 10:\nText: Does this <url> mean that individuals (e.g. Salvador Abascal) should be removed from category:antisemitism and its child categories?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: Hi, I reverted vandalism on a couple of your subpages that you transclude in your main userpage. Do you want me to semi-protect them (your subpages) so that it is more difficult for vandals to subtly vandalize you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hello -- I see you changed a couple of entries relating to \"PALATINE, the Subject Centre for Dance, Drama and Music of the UK Higher Education Academy\".  I don't know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 13:\nText: You blocked <url> earlier today: now we have <url> (<url>) (<url>). He's only done one nonsense page so far: is the name similarity enough to block as a sock?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: You won't even let the ink on your report dry and you're already at it again. Care to explain finally what about the DAB needs \"cleaning\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 15:\nText: If the Russia tricolor is not the flag of the Lokot Autonomy, than what is? Is the flag even available on Wikipedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 16:\nText: Hi- The Magnificent Clean-keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of \"notability\" as the reason. Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of \"notability\" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 17:\nText: \"Book\" in question is A4 or thereabouts, and runs to a grand total of 32 pages including covers. It does state that it is a journal of SIAS, No 18 / 1988. There's not much to choose between the two templates though, is there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: I found <url> which is completely unreferenced but I could not find any confirming sources. Is this a proper term, or even a hoax?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 19:\nText: thanks for the welcome! I have a question... how come you can't edit the article about Whales?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: Good job, great article. Where did you get the idea, out of curiosity?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 21:\nText: I found this talk page (and <url>) while deleting the user pages that you requested.  Would you like to have them deleted as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 22:\nText: I ran across this again this month. It <url> since we last saw it; do you still subscribe to your judgment <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 23:\nText: Who do you think will be the next president? Do you have a favorite yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: Yeah I'd be happy to look at the list, however can't promise much! Shall we discuss it on the article's talk page so that any comments are in the relevent place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: <url>???\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 26:\nText: This page, which you recently edited on, is constantly getting vandalized by a rival school. Could you please put an edit lock on the page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: I had to revert another one <url>. How about that protection?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 28:\nText: Thanks for the heads up, I don't think they will succeed but it's good to know they're planning it. Did you let Jayjg know as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 29:\nText: Any suggestions on what admin-specific readings I should be starting to go through, and what order? E.g., the actual mechanics of how to do some of the admin-related stuff?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 30:\nText: Are you there? I just posted YAP, Yet Another Plea, on <url>, might you wish to pitch in with something technical or at least magisterial?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I was wondering where you got your information for the dice statistics you recently added/changed in <url>.  Can you add a source to those tables?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
