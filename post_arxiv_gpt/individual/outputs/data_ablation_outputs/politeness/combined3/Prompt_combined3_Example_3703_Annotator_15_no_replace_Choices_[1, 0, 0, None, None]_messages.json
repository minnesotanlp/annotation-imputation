Is there a timeline expert that can come in a fix it if we recommend that action be taken?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 2:\nText: Wait. Unless ''you'' need it repaired and updated quickly ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 3:\nText: Yeah, chances are it is. How long do you reckon it will be before he edits a Sydney related article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: I'm sorry, I don't know what article you are talking about. Can you please provide the exact name?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 5:\nText: Where did you get the tracklist for the album? Can you please drop me a messafe with the link?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 6:\nText: There's no tab at the top of the page with a bold EDIT THIS PAGE on it. Is it just my computer?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 7:\nText: As I've only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut-and-paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly.  Was db-1 the right tag for <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 8:\nText: Thanks, but I've already read those essays.  Did you have anything to say yourself, personally?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 9:\nText: Well? What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 10:\nText: Iulius! Could you provide exact  reference of article u017dirmu016bnai part ''Demographics'' ethnicity  composition?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 11:\nText: Something's still not right with me here. Think you can perform one of those cleanups?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 12:\nText: I have looked back in my archives a year, and cannot find the issue concerned - although I certainly remember the name, your account, and the style. Can you give me the relevant link/diff, so I can refresh my memory and be best informed what action might be appropriate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 13:\nText: And individually changing the refs defeats the  purpose, unless the genus is apart of the url, like in nomen.at. Do you think there is any to work with this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 14:\nText: Good day, sorry to bother you. Is the 2:00 am news brief called eyewitness news everynite, and if it is do they play move closer to your world?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 15:\nText: I'm relatively new here. Short of totally protecting the pages, what strong-arm tactics do my colleagues have in mind?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 16:\nText: Ok well it'd be a great if it could be confirmed that MSNBC HD will be on DirecTV upon launch. Hey by any chance are you \"DodgerKing\" on any TV forums such as HighDefForums.com, SatelliteGuys.US or DBSTalk.com?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 17:\nText: I began to make an article for <url> but found that one already existed but was deleted. After reading the deletion log and seeing that it was speedy deleted for a7, I think I can write an article that establishes notability, but am I required to get administration approval before recreating a deleted article or can I just create it on my own?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: I'm confused. Why did I get a user warning relating to this article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 19:\nText: Thank you, it's much appreciated. What do you think of the changes so far?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 20:\nText: Whoops. How about now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: Im sorry to see that you withdrew. Maybe next time?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 22:\nText: No idea I never visit the page myself :-( . As it's obvious they are socks I figured  why wait?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 23:\nText: Then why is the article for the monastery in Lhasa as \"Ganden\" instead of \"Gandan\"? Do both the monasteries have the same name?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 24:\nText: Well, I think this is a murder that could do with wide categorisation (as an example of asian-on-white killings, rather than the far more famous white-on-black, not to mention that British does nto automatically=English. If it's merely a matter of preference, do you mind if I put the British one back?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 25:\nText: I agree with Orlady here; full-protection, a fairly serious position when we're talking about an encyclopedia anyone can edit, is only to be taken out as a last (reasonable) resort. Since both participants to the dispute are now blocked, is there any reason for the protection to be necessary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 26:\nText: Having said that, I don't want to drive anyone away just because they can't write well. The question is, where do you begin?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 27:\nText: i took the photo, and if the kludgy licensing template would allow me to license i would. do you actually fix things or tag spam?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: I'm with you - it really is a friggin' pain that people refuse to read no matter how big you put the text.  Should we just maybe remove the source entirely?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: I thought you had done that, and started working on turning it into a disambiguation page.  Could you now graft the history on to the changes I made?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 30:\nText: It's larger now than the sub-stub previously deleted.  Can sources be added to verify the achievements?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Per <url>, there was an autoblock affecting your editing that has now been lifted.  Can you edit freely now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 2:\nText: I found <url> while working <url> from <url>, my first impulse was to give it a prod, an long unreferenced orphan without a clear reason to exist.  I see you are still active on Wikipedia, is there chance you can do something for this article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 3:\nText: In retrospect \"in as far away as\" looks ungrammatical. Shouldn't it just be \"as far away as\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hey, so your move of this, and wanted to point out that the reason I put a disambig title on it, was because there are two different labor unions of the same name, either one of which could wind up with an article. But, I don't know that that means the article should automatically get the title, is there a standard for this situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \"naming\" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: In your most recent edit to <url> you stated that the track in Clermont, Florida does not fulfill IAAF regulations (since reverted by another editor).  On what grounds does it not and do you have a source for that remark?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hey Nick, thanks for writing the book reviews! Would you like me to run one or both of them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 8:\nText: Yeah I'd be happy to look at the list, however can't promise much! Shall we discuss it on the article's talk page so that any comments are in the relevent place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 9:\nText: I thought that only section tags go into sections while the article tags go to the top of the page so they could serve it's purpose. Is there a Wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: Hi.  Is there anything I can do to help you utilize the spell check features of your browser?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 12:\nText: You may not remember doing this but, you erased a page entitled, Earl Newton.  Why did you do it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: I think I do mark my pages patrolled. Doesn't Twinkle do it automatically?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: Your bot takes zh:u514bu91ccu65afu6258u5f17xb7u6885u7b56u723eu5fb7 off of the Christoph Metzelder page. What exactly is wrong with it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 15:\nText: Is this something that is needed, even though most of the links are still alive? Is there a WP: page describing this and how to do it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: In the article on <url>, you recently replaced a non-free image with J. Malcolm Greany's ''Ansel Adams and Camera'' on the basis that the latter image is in the public domain. How did you determine that this image is a work of the U.S. government?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 17:\nText: Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don't (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 18:\nText: I'm confused: what did you do?  And how did you delete it twice without restoring it in between?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 19:\nText: Thanks, the logo looks much better now. You wouldn't have a logo for the two predessesor clubs by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 20:\nText: Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: I noticed that you changed the formatting for <url> slightly, putting the links to 18-crown-6 and en to the sentence after the chemical structure rather than in the chemical structure itself. Why is that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 22:\nText: After <url> <url>, all/most of the needs specified have been completed. Do you think its worth re-nominating <url> for FA or GA status?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 23:\nText: And <url> targets <url>. Shouldn't it go to <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 24:\nText: '''Question''' to both of you.  Would it be considered canvassing to notify every participant of the AfD of the discussion at <url> and ask for their input?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 25:\nText: Did you mean to also remove the Breitbart reference from the \"Incidents\" section?  Have I missed a meeting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: This deleted page was recreated. Since you were the original nom., is this basically the same article, or has it been improved?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: You deleted Ricardo Marinello. What was written in the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 28:\nText: ''You wrote:'' I'm not trying to be obtuse, but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn't apply because the assertion of notability has been made?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 29:\nText: Jvhertum, Last year you made this change :http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Split-Second&action=historysubmit&diff=343316267&oldid=343252107 to the <url> article with the justification that \"A is part of the name\". This does not appear to be a valid reason to exclude it (<url> has a DEFAULTSORT of Beatles despite 'The' being part of the name), your thoughts ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: There are a few posts at <url> saying people are having trouble seeing the DYK picture that's up now. Do you think you could switch it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: In this <url> there was a loss of some info.  Was that intentional?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
