Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 4:
Text: To be quite frank it doesn't matter that the quotes don't appear any other place on the internet, the point is that they violate policy by being here and you could always set up a personal website to host them where all you'd have to worry about is fair use and not Wikipedia's stricter requirements. Are there more of these quote/source pages than <url>, <url> and <url>?

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 15:
Text: I've deleted the diagram from the <url> article because, as Curtis Clark points out in <url>, the diagram does not represent the results of the reference it purports to represent.

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 16:
Text: I actually went to the long term abuse page right now, and tried to block them, but it seems that those accounts don't exist. Have they been listed incorrectly?

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 22:
Text: Sorry, almost forgot. After calling me a "child" "uneducated" and making remarks to the effect of "shouldn't be allowed to post on edit Wikipedia" what grounds have you got to stand on to say I've made personal attacks against you by suggesting vandalism?
Annotation from annotator: 5

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 26:

Annotation from annotator: 2

Example 27:
