How can I see the content previously in the discussion page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: The animal has only just been discovered by western science: I've seen no claim of any photograph having been taken.  I have no idea of how to research/decide open the status of the computer gererated graphic that has been on many press reports: can you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 3:\nText: I'd rather not discuss matters by email, if it's avoidable. Is this a confidential issue that cannot be discussed on talk pages?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hoi TheDJ, ik denk dat jij <url> Michaelovic wel even de goede richting uit kan helpen. Kan jij even kijken?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: Currently, <url> is a subcategory of <url>. What would you suggest doing about this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: Hi. How come <url> can still edit?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hi, I wsa just noticing that in <url>, players such as Tommy Walsh and Paul O'Connor have appeared under 'T' and 'P' respectively, rather than 'W' and 'O'.  How should that be fixed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 8:\nText: You are able to read it here <url>. Wondering if this is worthy of sign post?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: I think I do mark my pages patrolled. Doesn't Twinkle do it automatically?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Actually, that's again a misromanization.  Would you ''please'' stop this insanity?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 11:\nText: I don't play club anymore (I stopped this year), I have just been too busy this year, but I will probably start again soon-ish. Where abouts do you play?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: It should be deleted. Do you want to nominate it or should I?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 13:\nText: This is helpful for automatized transfer scripts. By the way, did I get the location tag right on <url> :-) ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 14:\nText: Tell me, after your uni starts again, will you not be as present again? And when does it get over?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 15:\nText: Yes, I appreciate that my edits were not the best, but they are currently the best available in Wikipedia for guiding readers in understanding there the emergence of the legal systems of the United Kingdom. Do You have a better suggestion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 16:\nText: Unfortunately, I have no clue what you mean.  Can you point me to a page that has such a feature?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: Thanks, the logo looks much better now. You wouldn't have a logo for the two predessesor clubs by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 18:\nText: Can I also point out that the text that you pasted into Wikipedia is entirely inappropriate for an encyclopedia article and at best will require extensive editing to conform to the<url>. Are you going to do that editing, or are you going to leave it to one of the other 'lazy' people who edit this encyclopedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 19:\nText: But if there is no evidence that it has been downgraded, shouldn't it be kept as a Cat. 2?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 20:\nText: Do you think we're good to go with the proposal, maybe later tonight, or tomorrow? Any other problems with the proposal as it stands?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: Jason, how do you view your phone call to tlc's father&pastor in the light of the Biblical conflict resolution process? And in the light of the Wikipedian conflict resolution process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 22:\nText: Oh? You know something I don't, Friday?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 23:\nText: I don't think I'll have the time to keep the flies off it all week but I'll have a go (I might get around to incorporating Caitlin Moran's detailed reviews too). Could you not semi it as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: Your reasoning is very sound, it would appear that USGS is wrong and I have no problem with changing it back.  In general, what are your thoughts on using the GNIS database for park coordinates/elevations as we convert to the Geobox?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 25:\nText: <url> and <url> are both accounts which have vandalised the article, and both have been created solely for vandalism. I believe they're one and the same; do you know an admin that can take action?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 26:\nText: Well, the article is sourced to his official bio site (government), whereas none of the two sources you mentioned strikes me as strong. We've got <url>, why not follow the article sources and keep George Petalotis?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: Sure. Aside from the Flea and Frusciante articles, which get the most traffic?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 28:\nText: He used it to assert that '''''others''''' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 29:\nText: There may not be a lot of situations like this, but there will definitely be some. I was wondering if there is any kind of invisible comment that can be added to the article in these situations so that the report doesn't include it, or if you have any other thoughts about how it might be possible to handle this situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 30:\nText: <url> was a bit bad form. Think twice before you do it again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Yeah, I agree. What's up with that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Maybe there is a cellar to the mill, which would count towards the five. Can you get a photo or two and add to Commons?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: Do you really think it is necessary to do that? Could you not simply take my advice on board?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: OK done. When do I get my money?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 6:\nText: Great work you've been doing on this. Would you agree with me that International Political Economy should be capitalised?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: What is the policy when someone writes something like <url> ? Does their IP get banned and their comment purged from the talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 8:\nText: I've made some improvements to <url>, keeping in mind your previous comments about the article. Since you gave its grade before, would you like to see it if it could be reassessed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: lol, turns out the photo isn't his either. Any ideas from here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: Stopped and removed. Could you pease be more specific when speaking of anti-Russian bias, with references to articles that you think they have?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: At the top of my talk page, it says, \"If I left you a message: please answer on your talk page, as I am watching it.\"  I think I already explained this to you.  Is there a reason we cannot communicate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 13:\nText: Basically, I agree with you. <url>, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: This is my first time at review-sorry if I blew it.  The article passes just fine--what do I do at DYK to indicate that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: Then I think that we need to be a little poetic, rather than the rather prosaic \"qualities associated with his weapons\". What about something like \"the magical properties attributed to his weapons\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: I see you've added <url> to the category \"Jewish-Canadians\".  What is your source for this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: Some of his categories seem rather POV to me, and it's rather obvious from his AfD participation that there's a disruptive streak afoot. Since you've got a bit of knowledge in the area, do they seem like the kinds of things which should be deleted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: Thanks very much indeed! :-) I don't suppose you'd fancy having a deadlink trawl over at <url>, would you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 19:\nText: And can you point me to a statement of that company where they say that they release their images into the <url>? Or can you provide proof that their copyright has expired?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: That's fine. Question: how did you find that out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to do that <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: I didn't see your internal link, I put it back.  <url> isn't orphaned, what are you talking about?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 23:\nText: Well, that was an example as I am adding Infobox Historical American Political Party infobox to all those historical parties in <url> for which I was previously using the regular Infobox American Political Party until I found the Historical version in <url>.  So if I wish to continue, I will have to assign colors and shortname to all of them if not already done (like Anti-Masonic Party) right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: No problem. Have you seen the <url> article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: I'm not sure I understand what this has to do with what I said.  Could you restate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: Please answer Bishonen question to you. When were you invited to comment on UC related subjects?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 27:\nText: last msg ???\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: Can you respond to the comments I left on the S&M PR page please. If you are satisfied with the changes, can you tell me if it is qualifiable for FAN and if not for FAN, then for A class status?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: Hey, Rcej! ;) Would you be up to reviewing <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: Thanks, but I didn't see the 10,000 to 40,000,000 numbers there. Am I missing something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I looked at the quotations and they seemed aligned to me.  Is there something that I'm missing?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
