Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 4:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 5:
Text: Why have you included the Putnam Line in the MTA infobox, when it was never operated by the MTA (excepting the Marble Hill stub, which is hardly on a par with the Hudson Line, Harlem Line, etc.)?

Example 10:
Text: Why did you delete the article on anal stretching????
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 11:
Text: I looked at all the provinces and regencies listed on <url> - so that trick is mostly played out. I'm going down the alphabet now and I'm at the R's - if you want to work, maybe you could start at the end of the alphabet so we don't interfere with each other, meet in the middle?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 12:
Text: Well the only plausible explanation was that you reverted to where I removed an extraneous cat (after Homestarmy's edit) and then swapped out a template... but as you're a competent editor that just seemed odd. Is that what indeed occurred?

Example 16:
Text: "two pigeons in a row constitute a half-wave antenna at 700 MHz" That's a pretty cool intersection of radio invisible waves seems-like-magic and real-life objects! On the other hand, did you perhaps just crack the secret for implementing <url>?

Text: As a timid Wikipedia end-user who never makes more than a rare grammatical or spelling edit, learning the history to be found on this talk page and Kate's userpage history makes me sad.

Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 7:
Text: Per <url>, edits that change the meaning of an article shouldn't normally be marked as minor.  Looking at your recent contributions, I see they're all marked as minor... perhaps you've inadvertantly ticked the "Mark all edits minor by default" check box in the Editing tab of your user preferences?

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 12:
Text: Hello -- I see you changed a couple of entries relating to "PALATINE, the Subject Centre for Dance, Drama and Music of the UK Higher Education Academy".  I don't know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice?

Text: Hi- The Magnificent Clean-keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of "notability" as the reason. Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of "notability" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point?

Example 17:
Text: "Book" in question is A4 or thereabouts, and runs to a grand total of 32 pages including covers. It does state that it is a journal of SIAS, No 18 / 1988. There's not much to choose between the two templates though, is there?
