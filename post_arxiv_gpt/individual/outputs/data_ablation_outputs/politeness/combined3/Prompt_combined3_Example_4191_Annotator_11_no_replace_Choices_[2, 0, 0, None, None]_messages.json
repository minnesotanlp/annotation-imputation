Short of totally protecting the pages, what strong-arm tactics do my colleagues have in mind?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 2:\nText: I bow to your superior knowledge of Irish :-)  One question - the Irish Wikipedia is called Vikipedia? How so - there's no 'v' in the Irish alphabet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: I noticed, that for users warned before, Huggle still uses level 1 warning. Is there anything I can do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've commented on this on the talk page. Could it be resolved there, rather than both of you just reverting each other?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hardly. Does the <url> exercise executive control over Northern Ireland?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 6:\nText: See my comment on the talk page. How did this ever get to DYK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 7:\nText: I don;t like commons because when i try to link things in the description it never works because it links only to commons. what is that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: I saw you removed the copyright CSD from Universum University as being \"unclear copyright status\".  What am I missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 9:\nText: You recently edited this page. It is my view that this page is just a corporate marketing listing, there are several hundred companies that do the same job yet are not listed in Wikipedia - Do you not think that this is advertorial?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Very well I won't contact you anymore. Geez, whatever happen to the spirit of collaboration?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 11:\nText: I've asked Jza84 if he could have a go at drawing a new plan, he's asking if we have any source material he could work from. The only one I can think of is the plan currently in the article, do you have any others?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 12:\nText: It's just, what becomes of <url>? Is the mention really there or not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 13:\nText: I note that you've edited since this was brought up here. Could you please respond?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 14:\nText: I had that fixed before you oranged me, I swears it! :) Are you not familiar with the technique of doubling your edit count using typos?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 15:\nText: Hello. Who are you, and when are we to have met or communicated in the past?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 16:\nText: How is the copyediting going? Do you still need a copyeditor?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 17:\nText: The notion that a hunter would kill dozens of birds with a single shot seems outlandish to me.  Do you have a reference for this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 18:\nText: That sounds fine, but why would you want somebody who knows nothing about the show to write them? If you are informed about it, wouldn't you be a good person to do it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 19:\nText: OK, maybe I only started noticing it after that incident. Do you have diffs for your earlier opinions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 20:\nText: This template is misleading since the subject is a motorcycle racer and the template was made for Formula 1 drivers. Will I have to create a new template for motorcycle racers?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: PS, I would seriously like an answer to my question above. What is your native language and where do you come from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 22:\nText: FYI, it appears a \"campaign\" has begun where people are signing up to Wikipedia for the purpose of saying \"Keep\" on the James Girvin AfD page (<url>). This is the first time I'm seeing such a movement, if you wish to call it that... :) Have you seen something like this in the past?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: I thought this problem (non-Latin characters being changed to ??????? when people edit in certain browsers) had been fixed, but maybe there are browsers out there that don't support Unicode even with the fix?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: Maybe the ip adress is blocked???\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 25:\nText: Which of course is all the more ironic as my initial edits were an attempt to ''improve'' the article per <url>. Who the hell would have predicted all this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 26:\nText: Then why is the article for the monastery in Lhasa as \"Ganden\" instead of \"Gandan\"? Do both the monasteries have the same name?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: I have posted a question at <url> which you may be able to answer. Can you please return to that discussion to answer it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 28:\nText: Many thanks. I'm afraid I don't know the reel - is it played in your part or the world?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 29:\nText: Great work you've been doing on this. Would you agree with me that International Political Economy should be capitalised?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 30:\nText: Thanks, was getting worried there for a moment. Have you though of asking Outriggr for a hand with <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nHuman-Rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Still doing vandalism reverts by hand I see. Need any help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 2:\nText: Indeed, the New York Times tells us that Iain Hook \"''was shot in the back by an Israeli soldier ''\". Why did a member of the IDF shoot him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: I don't think so, Giano. Can we just once attempt to let this pass by without calling for the heads of people?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: I agree that terms like Australian Formula 1 need an explanation but isn't that why we link the term to the Australian Formula 1 page? Do we need to disrupt the flow of the article to explain a term which is already explained on the linked page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: According to <url>, links are permissible as part of your signature but be sure to check the \"'''Sign my name exactly as shown'''\" box.  What happens when you load '''<nowiki><url><url> (<url>)</nowiki>''' into the signature window and check the box?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: OK you're right- I guess IPs can't do it. I believe they're all fixed now, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: Thanks for your additional categorizing. :) I guess I could just look at your contributions, but before catting, what \"work\" were you doing previously?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 9:\nText: Great job. Will it be done by next week?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: Are you talking about that I noticed that <url> wasn't in <url> even though <person> was changed to use <person> on 6 October 2010? And then did some script-assisted editing to remove <url> from a bunch of pages that had both the category and <person>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: I state what I see when I read it.  Are you and <url> the same editor?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: I wondered, simply because I see you occasionally and had never seen him before, so at first I thought he was you.  I wonder if there's a User:Nyttned running around?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 13:\nText: Was working, so no. You?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 14:\nText: He's taken the notice down.  Doesn't this count as belaboring the point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: I asked some questions in the Criteria for Inclusion section on 20th Dec but no-one has yet responded. Can you take a look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 16:\nText: Oh, that's because I only copyedited a tiny section of the article. Should I still count that as a yes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 17:\nText: Point taken. Would you like to be a mod?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: I am sorry, got confused on who created this article. :-/ Apologies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 19:\nText: Sounds good then.  In this case, would it be wise to simply remove the \"influence\" field since it simply overlaps with \"subjects\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: It already look great. BTW, what are your thoughts about the previous post on the names of the other post office and rates lists?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 21:\nText: Wikipedia has a strict rule about ''not'' simultaneously filing an article in both a parent category ''and'' a subcategory of the same parent. Could you please ''not'' add <url> to a category if it's already in <url>, <url> or a country-specific record labels category?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 22:\nText: From the edit history to the template, it appears that your last edit has not been undone so hopefully this issue is resolved. You are both editors of between 1 and 2 years experience here, so perhaps a bit better communications would be a better approach in future?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: I've conceded on the infobox issue, but there are still some other outstanding issues, which I've addressed on the article talk page. Perhaps you would like to comment there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: Okay, I asked for help at <url>, was directed to <url>. What do you want to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Hey. I'm proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 26:\nText: I have your CH2.js installed, but I forgot what it does.  What does it do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: I made a change to your user page. Is that the change you wanted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 28:\nText: What the hell? Bitter much?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 29:\nText: I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information. Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: Did make me smile....a dreamtime legend of a tiger in WA of all places. Seems a long way to walk, even when there was a land bridge ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Good day, sorry to bother you. Is the 2:00 am news brief called eyewitness news everynite, and if it is do they play move closer to your world?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
