Perhaps adding a <person> template would draw in more participants?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 7:\nText: I have reverted your relocation of the images of this fragment - as I think it better if the images and transcripts can be seen side-by-side.  Do you agree?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: I have moved the navbox and the noinclude of the <url> to <url> because it would be stupid seeing an article called Template:PDC Top 16 when it is showing the top 20 players.

Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: Also, 'topological proof'?
