Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 3:
Text: In the article <url>, the names and details of all the recipients (both the chronological list and the alphabetical list) have now been completed. What steps should now be taken in order to reassess the article's rating on the Wikipedia Israel Project quality scale, and also to ensure that that the article is correctly referenced within the project?

Example 5:
Text: A follow-up question: How far away from the true ridge does the watershed extend, using your looser definition? Is it the entire hillside entire you enter a channel?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 6:
Text: I posted here rather than to Jon's page because I don't want to embarrass the students; I know Jon watchlists your page and I am sure other NRG editors do too.  Anyway, what do you think?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 7:
Text: As I have said before, it is an issue of breadth vs. depth. Are you familiar with such concepts?
Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 8:
Text: <person>, with whom you discussed linkspam in 2006, has returned. Could you offer your views on his talkpage?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 9:
Text: Looks like <url> (the one missing the side-chain) is unused and doesn't seem useful (due to that structural flaw). Maybe tag it for deletion?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 10:
Text: Why did you just do that? I am being serious - what business was it of yours exactly?
Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 11:
Text: I'm familiar with <url> and I don't think it violates <url>. Which specific provision of <url> are you referring to?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 12:

Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 15:
Text: I'd like not to receive any notices from this bot on my talk page. Is there a way to do this?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 16:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:
Text: When JaGaBot updated the monthly challenge winners on <url>, it stripped the image. Could the bot be fixed to leave the image?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 18:
Text: Actually, material in the lead must be discussed in the body. Contemporary economics haven't been discussed in the body, so how can they be discussed in the lead?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 19:
Text: The placement of the hyphen in "Ekur-huleni" seems odd: as far as I know "rh" is one sound in Tsonga. Maybe "Eku-rhuleni"?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 20:
Text: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 21:
Text: Hi, it looks as if SVG images in taxoboxes are not counted when producing the list of tree of life articles without images. Is that intended ?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 22:
Text: ..to Giggy's RfA. Did you mean to remove 2,066 bytes of replies?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 23:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 27:
Text: Sorry, another issue has taken my attention, and I don't think I can get to this task. Since you are running AWB, and have thought through how to do the regexes, is there a reason you can't make the heading change yourself?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 28:
Text: However, I will admit that there are enough hits on Google about "Fraudulent hoax" that we could possibly make an article out of it. Is that ok with you?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 29:
Text: That's basically what our members have said, not necessarily my opinion. Anything I miss?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 30:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Human-rated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was "Left-libertarianism in political philosophy".  If it were changed back to something like that and moved to the top, would that be satisfactory?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 2:
Text: So argument that "''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 3:
Text: No problem, done. What's your connection to Casey?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 4:
Text: I've been "busy" (all day today in Death Valley admiring the spring bloom), and I would like to get at least partial buyin from HG if possible. Not a big hurry to rename, right?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 5:
Text: So you are still sidestepping the question.  Please answer it directly:  please answer my question, clearly:  are you saying is that you cannot use the wiki to edit cooperatively with other people on the same text, or are you saying that you can use the wiki as it was intended and edit a single text cooperatively?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 6:
Text: I'd be glad to help, if you like. How should we divide it, by section or by criteria?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 7:
Text: Hey, what was with the fact tag? Do you dispute its name?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 8:
Text: You may need to enable your own setting to allow E-mail too; I'm not sure. If so, maybe you can turn it on temporarily, so that you can send me one e-mail?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 9:
Text: I see you have a BugZilla account. How do you make it so it doesn't show your email to everybody?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 12:

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 13:
Text: Thank you for the links and the explanation. I'd like to help with the project, what did you have in mind?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 14:
Text: Hmm. Over?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 15:
Text: I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the "sh" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 16:
Text: Thanks; I expected a decline, despite my extensive comments at <url>. As there is nothing more to this article than listings of bylines in non-notable publications, minor book acknowledgments, uncredited movie extra roles, blog comments, paid directory listings, and unsubstantiated claims about wildly over-the-top PR accomplishments, what exactly do you consider to be the examples of "credible notability"?
Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 17:
Text: Why nominate this for deletion? It was obviously created by someone who didn't know how to use redirects, so would it not be best to just correct it?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 18:
Text: So, I'm a "deletion fanatic"? Why don't you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people?
Annotation from annotator: 3

Example 19:
Text: That's nice. May I ask why you noticed this?
Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 20:
Text: I was thinking more of making the line longer so that the team's name can fit on it. Is that doable?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 21:
Text: I agree with Deb. Is there anything else you are interested in besides city planning?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 22:
Text: I removed that second paragraph entirely, since the information is covered in the article.  Do you feel that the lead should be larger?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 23:
Text: You had problems with both versions? Do you have cookies enabled in <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 24:
Text: Unfortunately for those who like railroads, it's been closed again! DOn't you people have better things to do?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 25:
Text: Thanks for your additional categorizing. :) I guess I could just look at your contributions, but before catting, what "work" were you doing previously?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 26:
Text: Meh - perhaps not, and they will most likely be closed as renames, but I figured another week to allow anyone who wants to to comment wouldn't hurt anything since you as the nominator were the only one who had commented so far. Is there something I missed, or a hurry to get these quickly renamed?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 27:
Text: Sure thing, you've been doing great work so far. Would it help to maybe translate the whole article first as it is, and then over the course of time you can play around with the sections and add stuff that you find?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 28:
Text: Interesting; I thought I was fairly familiar with Wikipedia rules. Which rules exactly did I violate by closing an AfD (allegedly) without reading the underlying article?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 29:
Text: It appears that that article was deleted because not enough info was found on the person. Doesn't the new article have enough info?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 30:
Text: Unless you provide a wikipedia article, with solid references od proof of notability of the term, I am going to delist it. I ave no doubts that there was a dilike of Portugals (like any other major nation), but was this word in notable circulation?
