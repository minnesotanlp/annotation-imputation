Annotation from annotator: 11

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 23:

Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 24:

Example 3:
Text: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 4:
Text: In my calculation if I got blocked that would only be good for me as it would clear my mind from the obsession to try and change that which seems wrong and mutable, but carries no private benefits for the reformer. Is that line of thinking truly alien to you?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: My post above was a helpful hint about following DYK as a whole, not about the nomination process. Would you mind posting your post under a new heading, as it seems to have little to do with what I was saying and seems to be changing the subject?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 6

So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom?

Example 8:
Text: I'm in Japan timezone - and at work now - and most IRC is totally blocked through work proxies.  Can we do a weekend?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 9:
Text: Thanks, but why specifically? Because I know the difference between ''hale'' and ''hail''?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 10:
Text: You are just saying that <math>frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</math> is continuous at <math>h=0</math>, but that is not the same as saying <math>f'(x)</math> is continuous. Do you have any references?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Annotation from annotator: 11

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 18:
Text: What's with all the crap behind him? Was this at a signature desk?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 19:
Text: It should be deleted. Do you want to nominate it or should I?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 20:
Text: I have to protest that I find it rather meaningless to present arguments on the talk page for edits which are then blankly reverted by the likes of User:Historicar without explanation or discussion. Any suggestions for a more formal process or other remedies?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 21:
Text: Good luck with the remaining time for your nomination. BTW: under what section on <url> do you think it should appear?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Annotation from annotator: 7

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 27:
Text: Hmm, there was a 7th <url> - but someone deleted him from <url> after removing the Prod. Is that kocher?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 28:
Text: <url>, whom you indefblocked almost a year ago, is requesting another chance and seems penitent. Have you any comments?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 29:
Text: I don't understand. So then you decide by yourself, and the people who stated their support for the original are ignored?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 30:
Text: Making edits vanish without a trace would be ''extremely'' difficult to do u2013 only full <url> could do that, and I can assure you the oversighters wouldn't do such a thing just to allow somebody to cover their tracks. Maybe you are mis-remembering something, about edits that were in fact on some other page?
