Do you feel that you've done what you said you were going to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 2:\nText: Thank you for your input in my article on Iowa State Track and Field! I am trying to improve the article more and wondered if you could look at it and make suggestions that may improve the current content?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 3:\nText: And, by the way, shouldn't there have to be actual copyright VIOLATIONS (not just a lack of a machine-readable tag) to delete a photograph? Or are we so concerned with making our project bot-friendly that it doesn't matter if we lose really great images in the process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 4:\nText: An article about a craver named <url> needs some work. Can you clean the article up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hello, Jeff79. Would you weigh in on the above linked discussion regarding an edit you made?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: I wouldn't know where to put it. I know Record Charts is for charts etc and the certifications but where would I put a discography question?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 7:\nText: <url>.  Draft beer?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: One more thing if you want, let's talk on the Seinfeld talk page. I think I am taking up your talk page so let's talk there instead, ok?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks. Any idea how I log into this account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 10:\nText: If the llamas of Peru spoke Spanish, and one asked the other, ''xbfCxf3mo se llama?'', would he get confused?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Thanks for the various corrections you have made to this article. Do you have a source for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date of 921, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 12:\nText: Just curious... Where did it come from?  Where did you cut and paste it from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: I was thinking about bringing that up.  I wonder if this is the first time someone's beat me to it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hi, I meant to do this a long time ago, but I guess I forgot.  You are the \"Sandpiper\" on the HP wiki right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 15:\nText: Haha, hey guys. Who is Temple alumni?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 16:\nText: It would be even funnier if you did attend the rally but weren't the giant tea bag guy I added to your user page. Did you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 17:\nText: I don't understand the system there. What does bold mean?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 18:\nText: This is not a suitable candidate for CSD as it asserts notability.

I don't know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 20:\nText: Hi, what are the technical steps to withdraw a nomination to delete a category? Or more specifically, what template did you use to withdraw your nomination?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 21:\nText: A redirect works exactly the same way regardless of whether there's a space between \"#REDIRECT\" and the target article's name or not. Why bother removing spaces from the redirects if it doesn't change the functionality at all?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 22:\nText: Hello, again. Would you care to intervene at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 23:\nText: Tim, it strikes me that DNA is getting more than average vandalism for daytime; I suspect it's schoolbreak week somewhere.  I'm not able to help much as it takes so long for the page to load; do you think it's time to ask for a semi-protection break?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 24:\nText: Just one more thing: The <url>' logo was re-made as a vector image a little while ago, but the colors (especially the skin), really seem to be off. Can you fix it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 25:\nText: In your most recent edit to <url> you stated that the track in Clermont, Florida does not fulfill IAAF regulations (since reverted by another editor).  On what grounds does it not and do you have a source for that remark?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: Blocked, templated.  Next?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 27:\nText: Anyway, if you feel that strongly about it we should at least add a summary. Whats you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 28:\nText: In an article like <url>, I think it would be better if you based the content on secondary sources rather than articles that you have found in the ''BMJ'''s online archive. Could I persuade you to discuss your additions on <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 29:\nText: An excellent news, indeed! I don't have time to have a look at it right now (busy with the fr FA), but do they have something on Gndevank?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 30:\nText: From looking at the talk page archive, I see you you were a voice of moderation at <url> some time ago.  Care to weigh in there again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nHuman-rated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Excellent, thanks!

Did you intend \"support going to Arbcomm\" to be a vote for the \"Death\" entry?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 3:\nText: What would the recommended sequencing be, then?... GAR, then FAR?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've read everything again, and I still think it's the right decision. What I'm confused about is if you claim that <url> does not care about capitalisation, how do you explain <url>, <url> and <url> (examples given on the talk page)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: Are you kidding me? Do you even bother to click on <url> to see its fleet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 6:\nText: No worries, thanks for doing that. Nice to hear from you again - new username for 2013?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 7:\nText: Meh - perhaps not, and they will most likely be closed as renames, but I figured another week to allow anyone who wants to to comment wouldn't hurt anything since you as the nominator were the only one who had commented so far. Is there something I missed, or a hurry to get these quickly renamed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 8:\nText: Don't add any more trash to the article. Got it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 9:\nText: Although Singapore does not use Traditional Chinese, I still think we should at least add Traditional Chinese titles for shows not made by Mediacorp, and bought from overseas (mainly Hong Kong) TV stations. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 10:\nText: I don't like the idea of switching the order halfway through, especially as you would you have to decide an arbitrary cut-off point. Perhaps you should raise this on <url>, and see what people think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: Hi GW.. I was a bit bored today, so I made this: <url>.. What do you think so far?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 12:\nText: Is this really notable?  Time for an AfD nom?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: I see a \"remove protection\" tab on the <url>, which tells an admin that the article is protected.  Are you still able to edit it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 14:\nText: I did not have intention to put the username signature into any article. Where did you find it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 15:\nText: why can't you use corporate authorship? if Deutsche Bank can claim ownership of those emails can't Charter 97 claim ownership of the picture?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 16:\nText: So you deny you did anything wrong Jason?  And we're all Nazi's persecuting you, Itake and Uncle Davey?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 17:\nText: If it works consistently, a printonly abbreviation would make sense. But how many editors would actually see that form to catch problems should they arise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 18:\nText: Another admin has already deleted the article. Do you need me to restore it for you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 19:\nText: That \"guest\" could have been an undercover Colbert staff member and the whole segment could have been staged. Otherwise, why would Colbert have taken 3 minutes out of his show to talk to someone in the audience?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 20:\nText: Hi, I have opened a discussion at <url>.

I trust that you'll do what ya gotta do, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 22:\nText: An issue has been raised at <url> about this article, which you created. Maybe you can clear up the confusion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 23:\nText: Hi there, I've found some peer-reviewed publications that discuss Hoser's work. Could you take another look at the article and the AfD discussion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 24:\nText: I thought I had explained it pretty clearly.  What part did you disagree with?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 25:\nText: I need to read more about what exactly a pastoral opera is supposed to be. Perhaps it should be a supercategory?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 26:\nText: I'm not sure what you mean by the old factory farming discussion. Is something missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 27:\nText: Thanks for the help! That info should be on <url> in easy to read form, no?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 28:\nText: I apologize if I have misunderstood.  Are you not an acknowledged devotee of Prem Rawat?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 29:\nText: I removed the hyphen from \"oldest-known\", which is hard to see if you aren't looking for it. Does that answer the question?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 30:\nText: I don't think it is too unreasonable to archive messages you have read by deleting them - they are still available in the page history. Is there a policy guideline that they should be archived, and not deleted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Leon Liebgold played a rabbi. Was he a rabbi?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
