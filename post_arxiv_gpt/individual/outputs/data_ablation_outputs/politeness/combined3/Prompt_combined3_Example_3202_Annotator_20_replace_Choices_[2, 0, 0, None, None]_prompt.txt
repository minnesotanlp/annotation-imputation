Annotation from annotator: 14

Human-Rated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: Awesome! What was I doing wrong in the Italian films?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 2:
Text: I had a quick scan through the <url> article, which while good seems to be to suffer from the negative effects of "summary style" when used on very large topics - namely that while the individual sections are good summaries of what they are describing, the ''overall'' article lacks a coherent flow, a narrative taking the reader from beginning to end. Does that make sense?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Text: No problem, It was open and shut <url> issue. For your next project can you find something that doesnt make your fanclub at the Wikipedia Review angry?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 9:
Text: Firstly, why do you assume I don't care about the content, and secondly, what chance have you given anyone to voice a dissenting opinion? Correct me if I am wrong, but you don't seem to have asked if anyone had a problem with the merge, did you?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 10:
Text: The only books by Paul I was able to find were ''Concordia the Lutheran Confessions: A Readers Edition of the Book of Concord'' (Hardcover  - not yet released) and ''Communion fellowship: A resource for understanding, implementing, and retaining the practice of closed communion in the Lutheran parish'' (Unknown Binding - Jan 1, 1992).  Are those his scholarly works?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 11:
Text: Problem is how do you recognise the categories, as there are thousands of them. I have already made a program that scans the database, and can locate the unstubbed articles, so finding the untagged stubs is ok, and AWB automatically adds the stub tag if the article is short, I just can't think how you could program it to automatically guess the type of stub, any ideas?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Text: I'm going to remove it. Is that okay with you?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 28:
