What am I missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 12:\nText: 172 has refused to materially defend his take on NOR in terms of any criteria in <url> even abrasively deleting a query from a newbie on the subject in his talk page.

What do you think of <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: <url>, whom you indefblocked almost a year ago, is requesting another chance and seems penitent.

Do you need me to restore it for you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 15:\nText: A long time ago, you deleted this article.
