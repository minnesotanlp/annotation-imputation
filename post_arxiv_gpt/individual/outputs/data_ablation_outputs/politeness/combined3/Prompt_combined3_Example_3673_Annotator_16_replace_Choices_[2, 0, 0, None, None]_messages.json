Why are you doing what you are doing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 3:\nText: If it's alright with you, I'm next going to start from 1930 and work back towards where you are, since I'm particularly interested in the Lang era. Is that okay?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 4:\nText: I was reading the article reverse overshot wheel, but I can't find anything about the \"reverse\" part. Can you expand this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi, I am having problems with one of the references you added as it goes to the main page and not to one showing any of the figures on religion. Can you have a look at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: Were you the person who originally put FoxTrot up for peer review?

What is the problem here, and how does it violate wikipedia policy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 13:\nText: The YA article is a right trainwreck, and having had to do much of the exact same work on <url> and <url>, I'm not keen to do it again a third time on <url>, and then defend three separate articles from identical POV pushes. Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hi- The Magnificent Clean-keeper- I note that you recently removed a contribution I made to the <url> page, citing lack of \"notability\" as the reason. Iu2019m not saying you where wrong to do so (notability is an important criteria in the Wiki project), however, since the definition of \"notability\" is hard to pin down, could we discuss this particular instance, in greater detail, at some point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 15:\nText: I'll also add some categories to cover the collaboration nomination procedure and we should think about setting up a project <url>.

You violated Wikipedia's policies and were blocked rightly for it; you've been given a second chance and instead of being productive you come here to moan about a comment I made more than six months ago, that I still stand by, and to pursue your now year-old vendetta against Nick?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 19:\nText: Here's <url> and <url>.

Would you be interested in creating an infobox for windmills so that I could use it on individual windmill articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 28:\nText: Not sure how much the vote matters, though.

Could you please break them up into (many) smaller subpages?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Thankyou Fail, but the template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like 'This article is a copy of the (X) article in the German wikipedia, version 21 December 2009 10:04.'
