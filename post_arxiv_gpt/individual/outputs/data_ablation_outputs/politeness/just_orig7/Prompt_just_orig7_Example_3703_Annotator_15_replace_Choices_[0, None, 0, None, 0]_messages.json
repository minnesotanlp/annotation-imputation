Can you edit freely now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 2:\nText: I found <url> while working <url> from <url>, my first impulse was to give it a prod, an long unreferenced orphan without a clear reason to exist.  I see you are still active on Wikipedia, is there chance you can do something for this article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 3:\nText: In retrospect \"in as far away as\" looks ungrammatical. Shouldn't it just be \"as far away as\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hey, so your move of this, and wanted to point out that the reason I put a disambig title on it, was because there are two different labor unions of the same name, either one of which could wind up with an article. But, I don't know that that means the article should automatically get the title, is there a standard for this situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \"naming\" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: In your most recent edit to <url> you stated that the track in Clermont, Florida does not fulfill IAAF regulations (since reverted by another editor).

Is there a Wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: Hi.  Is there anything I can do to help you utilize the spell check features of your browser?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 12:\nText: You may not remember doing this but, you erased a page entitled, Earl Newton.  Why did you do it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: I think I do mark my pages patrolled. Doesn't Twinkle do it automatically?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: Your bot takes zh:u514bu91ccu65afu6258u5f17xb7u6885u7b56u723eu5fb7 off of the Christoph Metzelder page. What exactly is wrong with it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 15:\nText: Is this something that is needed, even though most of the links are still alive?

How did you determine that this image is a work of the U.S. government?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 17:\nText: Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don't (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 18:\nText: I'm confused: what did you do?  And how did you delete it twice without restoring it in between?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 19:\nText: Thanks, the logo looks much better now. You wouldn't have a logo for the two predessesor clubs by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 20:\nText: Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: I noticed that you changed the formatting for <url> slightly, putting the links to 18-crown-6 and en to the sentence after the chemical structure rather than in the chemical structure itself. Why is that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 22:\nText: After <url> <url>, all/most of the needs specified have been completed.
