Which user accused you vandalism?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 2:\nText: But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''<url>'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 3:\nText: When we have a GLAM barnstar then you get it ..... just for the Hindi article! I cannot explain why you needed to create a Derby page in Hindi - surely it should be there already?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 4:\nText: Actually, that's again a misromanization.  Would you ''please'' stop this insanity?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 5:\nText: I was going to create the list of tallest buildings in Hartford, when I saw that it had been deleted three years ago by you. I don't understand the reason for deletion; can you clarify why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 6:\nText: Lol, yes, simply! I would have no objection to something like this \"According to \".... Records\" the song was sent to mainstream radio as the official third single in may.\" OR something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: I'm an admin, I'd be happy to do it. You want me to do it now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 8:\nText: I think that's a good solution.  Should we give it a try?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 9:\nText: If she's been in a lot of porn movies, doesn't that show she is famous. Can't you undelete it and then let it go to a AfD discussion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 10:\nText: I think a separate security section heading is required in <url> article as it gets prime billing in the introduction, but then has references (and criticisms) scattered throughout the rest of the article.  Do you support this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: See <url>. I've made them, can you help fill them out and place them in the articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: Ok.  By the way, may I note that is an excellent resource you have there.   I noticed the other day that we had acquired a list at <url> of unproduced scripts/stories - it seems entirely genuine and fits with material I have read elsewhere but was uncited - I wonder if you could help find a source for it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: I don't think I've used it in Wikipedia.  So, if I haven't, why did you bring it up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 14:\nText: Which seems to be exactly in line with my point about album covers. If you were referring only to logos, could you please qualify why they should be treated differently?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 15:\nText: Checkuser shows the three users share an ip from time to time. How serious is the problem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 16:\nText: Sorry??? Which comment are you referring to?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 17:\nText: Thank you for your comments. May I refer you to <url>, where I think you will find the sort of criticism section that you are looking for?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 18:\nText: Wait, what's the COI? Was this on the fringe noticeboards?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 19:\nText: Somewhat related, shouldn't <url>, be renamed to <url>? I realize that Baha'i forbids sectarianism, but this is what the article is about, no?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: Ah, I was confused by the fact that your tag was placed on <url>, not on <url>.  Wildbot has visited, & updated the talk page again, so where is the result of the whole exercise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 21:\nText: I see you've added <url> to the category \"Jewish-Canadians\".  What is your source for this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: Thanks, I didn't notice the earlier discussion. Would you consider (if you haven't done so yet) adding some indication on either page that these are the same user?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: I'm going to try and hurry the <url> article through both GA and FA to see if I can get it as the Featured Article on the Main Page in time for its 20-year anniversary on October 18, 2009. Care to help a little or a lot?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 24:\nText: I don't understand. So then you decide by yourself, and the people who stated their support for the original are ignored?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 25:\nText: My post above was a helpful hint about following DYK as a whole, not about the nomination process. Would you mind posting your post under a new heading, as it seems to have little to do with what I was saying and seems to be changing the subject?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 26:\nText: There hasn't been much progress made in the last three days. Is anyone interested in responding?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: Already past my two \"spelling correction\" edits ;) (though they are obsessed with defense). I noticed one of them changed a quoted spelling: ''acknowledgment'' to ''acknowledgement'', did you get that one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 28:\nText: Make that \"copyvio tag\". OK if I revert under those conditions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 29:\nText: Hi Thunderbrand, thanks for letting me know that the image I uploaded is on IFD. Can I ask though, why is the image being deleted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: The Italian and English rules are different from the Spanish. But if you think about it, would it make sense to list every reserve player who makes a first team appearance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nTarget Example:\nText: You didn't answer about the status of above mentioned image. Are you going to tag that image too?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer and nothing else."
