Have you tried the normal dispute resolution avenues?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hmm, well I'll see before judging.  Does it also allow them to be listed from newest-to-oldest and separated into Russian and English references?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: I'm not sure I understand what this has to do with what I said.

Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: Yes, and there has been a user from an AOL IP who has been trolling Pilotguy for weeks. Why must you blindly disagree with everything anyone says to you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: I give that a huge second. Why haven't you signed onto the wikiproject yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 11:\nText: Stephen's solution certainly isn't optimal.

Why not go somewhere else?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 15:\nText: eh, i've ALWAYS hated 50 meter pools (200 butterfly was always the BIGGEST pain in the ass) although i really did like butterfly for some reason.... never quite got that, so was it an indoor or outdoor pool????\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 16:\nText: You are talking about direktor, right? He begin the edit war again, as seen by diffs, so C was blocked instead of direktor, see?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 17:\nText: Yes, I apologize, my friend (I guess I have some kind of a phobia that you will forget about my posts :) ) I will wait as long as you want me to. Could you read Mir Harven's posts on talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: SPI is not for just simple yes no answers. Why did you not warn the Minneapolis IP, they are warring as much as Bb23?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 19:\nText: Never mind, got it.

What's your connection to Casey?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 22:\nText: Thank you very much for your kind comments but I don't recall if or when I made these contributions. Are you sure it was me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 23:\nText: Thanks a lot for clearing that up. Do you also happen to know about the age of consent in Thailand, and why he could be charge with child sex offenses even though she was 17 years old?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 24:\nText: It may very well have been a better candidate for a stub rather than a speedy deletion. I would rather not talk about this on another users talk page, if you would like to discuss if further could we continue any further posts on <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Is there any way I could talk you into being more conservative with creation of new articles?  Do you agree that some of what you're creating here would be seen as obviously deletable material by most editors?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: The above username has been indefinitely banned as a phishing account.

If I remember correctly, you said you planned on cleaning up after the bot tagged the images; is that still the case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 30:\nText: I've deleted the old versions of ''Winnie the Pooh'' and ''Prom'', but I haven't deleted the other two yet: on the ''Elite Force'' image, the image you've uploaded says \"Mac\" on the box, while the description says it's for the PC; and the external link supplied for the ''127 Hours'' poster shows the original image that was here. Shouldn't these be made consistent first?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Im sorry to see that you withdrew.
