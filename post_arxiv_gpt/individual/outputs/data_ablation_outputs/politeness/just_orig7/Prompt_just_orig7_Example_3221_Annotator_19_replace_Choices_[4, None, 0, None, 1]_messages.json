Can we do something about this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: Come on Mohrflies, I donxb4t understand why you insist in these edits: <url>?

Any further thought?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: Converting <url> to a redirect without preserving either the information or sources, & without discussion was ill-advised.
