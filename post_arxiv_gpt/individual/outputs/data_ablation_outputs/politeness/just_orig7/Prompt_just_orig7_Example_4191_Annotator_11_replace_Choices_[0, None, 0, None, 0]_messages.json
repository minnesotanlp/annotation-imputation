Need any help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 2:\nText: Indeed, the New York Times tells us that Iain Hook \"''was shot in the back by an Israeli soldier ''\". Why did a member of the IDF shoot him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: I don't think so, Giano. Can we just once attempt to let this pass by without calling for the heads of people?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: I agree that terms like Australian Formula 1 need an explanation but isn't that why we link the term to the Australian Formula 1 page? Do we need to disrupt the flow of the article to explain a term which is already explained on the linked page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: According to <url>, links are permissible as part of your signature but be sure to check the \"'''Sign my name exactly as shown'''\" box.  What happens when you load '''<nowiki><url><url> (<url>)</nowiki>''' into the signature window and check the box?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: OK you're right- I guess IPs can't do it. I believe they're all fixed now, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: Thanks for your additional categorizing. :) I guess I could just look at your contributions, but before catting, what \"work\" were you doing previously?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 9:\nText: Great job. Will it be done by next week?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: Are you talking about that I noticed that <url> wasn't in <url> even though <person> was changed to use <person> on 6 October 2010? And then did some script-assisted editing to remove <url> from a bunch of pages that had both the category and <person>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: I state what I see when I read it.  Are you and <url> the same editor?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: I wondered, simply because I see you occasionally and had never seen him before, so at first I thought he was you.  I wonder if there's a User:Nyttned running around?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 13:\nText: Was working, so no. You?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 14:\nText: He's taken the notice down.  Doesn't this count as belaboring the point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: I asked some questions in the Criteria for Inclusion section on 20th Dec but no-one has yet responded. Can you take a look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 16:\nText: Oh, that's because I only copyedited a tiny section of the article. Should I still count that as a yes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 17:\nText: Point taken. Would you like to be a mod?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: I am sorry, got confused on who created this article. :-/ Apologies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 19:\nText: Sounds good then.  In this case, would it be wise to simply remove the \"influence\" field since it simply overlaps with \"subjects\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: It already look great. BTW, what are your thoughts about the previous post on the names of the other post office and rates lists?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 21:\nText: Wikipedia has a strict rule about ''not'' simultaneously filing an article in both a parent category ''and'' a subcategory of the same parent. Could you please ''not'' add <url> to a category if it's already in <url>, <url> or a country-specific record labels category?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 22:\nText: From the edit history to the template, it appears that your last edit has not been undone so hopefully this issue is resolved. You are both editors of between 1 and 2 years experience here, so perhaps a bit better communications would be a better approach in future?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: I've conceded on the infobox issue, but there are still some other outstanding issues, which I've addressed on the article talk page. Perhaps you would like to comment there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: Okay, I asked for help at <url>, was directed to <url>.

I'm proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 26:\nText: I have your CH2.js installed, but I forgot what it does.

Bitter much?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 29:\nText: I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information. Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: Did make me smile....a dreamtime legend of a tiger in WA of all places. Seems a long way to walk, even when there was a land bridge ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Good day, sorry to bother you. Is the 2:00 am news brief called eyewitness news everynite, and if it is do they play move closer to your world?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer corresponding to the label."
