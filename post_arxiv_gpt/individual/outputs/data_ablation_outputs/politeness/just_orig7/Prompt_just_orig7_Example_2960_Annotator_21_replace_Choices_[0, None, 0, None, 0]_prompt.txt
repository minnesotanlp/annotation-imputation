Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 2:
Text: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 3:
Text: Maybe there is a cellar to the mill, which would count towards the five. Can you get a photo or two and add to Commons?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 4:
Text: Do you really think it is necessary to do that? Could you not simply take my advice on board?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: OK done. When do I get my money?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Text: Great work you've been doing on this. Would you agree with me that International Political Economy should be capitalised?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 7:

Annotation from annotator: 14

Text: I've made some improvements to <url>, keeping in mind your previous comments about the article. Since you gave its grade before, would you like to see it if it could be reassessed?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 9:
Text: I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Text: lol, turns out the photo isn't his either. Any ideas from here?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 11:
Text: Stopped and removed. Could you pease be more specific when speaking of anti-Russian bias, with references to articles that you think they have?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 12:
Text: At the top of my talk page, it says, "If I left you a message: please answer on your talk page, as I am watching it."  I think I already explained this to you.  Is there a reason we cannot communicate?

Example 13:
Text: Basically, I agree with you. <url>, right?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 15:

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 16:
Text: I see you've added <url> to the category "Jewish-Canadians".  What is your source for this?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:
Text: Some of his categories seem rather POV to me, and it's rather obvious from his AfD participation that there's a disruptive streak afoot. Since you've got a bit of knowledge in the area, do they seem like the kinds of things which should be deleted?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 18:
Text: Thanks very much indeed! :-) I don't suppose you'd fancy having a deadlink trawl over at <url>, would you?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 19:
Text: And can you point me to a statement of that company where they say that they release their images into the <url>? Or can you provide proof that their copyright has expired?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 20:
Text: That's fine. Question: how did you find that out?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 21:
Text: On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to do that <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 23:
Text: Well, that was an example as I am adding Infobox Historical American Political Party infobox to all those historical parties in <url> for which I was previously using the regular Infobox American Political Party until I found the Historical version in <url>.

Text: No problem. Have you seen the <url> article?
Annotation from annotator: 12
