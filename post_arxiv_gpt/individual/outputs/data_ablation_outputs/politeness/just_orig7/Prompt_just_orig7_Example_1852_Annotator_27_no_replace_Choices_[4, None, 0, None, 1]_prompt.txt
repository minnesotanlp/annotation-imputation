Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 6:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Text: I clearly provided a source that is valid, and yet a couple of hours is a big deal? Is it your way, or the highway?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 10:
Text: I was just looking again at the April Fool's pranks from this year and came upon <url> to a page you deleted per "housecleaning".  Can we undelete and move it somewhere (the latter only if necessary), tagging with <url> in the process?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Text: ARSBot seems to not be working? Can it be turned back on?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 13:
Text: Hi, what does this mean - if I am to be a named party in the case I at least need ot understand what it is about, please explain - ""Feuding and BLPs" a case to examine meta behavioral issues and reconcile the applicable principles??? - what do you perceive this is related to?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 21:
Text: Tim, it strikes me that DNA is getting more than average vandalism for daytime; I suspect it's schoolbreak week somewhere.  I'm not able to help much as it takes so long for the page to load; do you think it's time to ask for a semi-protection break?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 22:
Text: Either <url> is really misinterpreting the guidelines or I missed out on something. Care to shed light here?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 23:
Text: I'll be touch and go for a few days, but hopefully I will have a stable connection again. In the mean time, I think there are a few things I need to get caught up on, yes?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 24:
Text: Can you help with this user: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Wallak I suspect that it is sockpuppet of banned user Bonaparte and he vandalizing various articles related to Romanians and Vlachs. Can we do something about it?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 25:
Text: Do you mind telling me why you haven't reverted my rewriting of the first sentence, and changes to the introduction? Perhaps you would prefer to delete the two new biographies that I have just started to cover the red links?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 26:
Text: Thank you ''very much'' for partaking in my effort to have a listing of stable article revisions. How do you suggest we get this project off the ground?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 27:
Text: I don't understand how you find it appropriate to talk about your illegal drug use on your user page.  Also, how do you have the right to ban other people's usernames with a name like "'''BONG'''warrior"?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 28:
Text: I am reluctant to mention this, but having your paragraph in bold on <url> seems to me to be a bit self-promotional and unfair to the other members. Is there any chance that I might be able to persuade you to voluntarily unbold it?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 29:
Text: If you're interested, I could provide you with Subversion (which is superior to CVS) for VandalProof. Interested?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 20

Target Example:
Text: Hello -- I see you changed a couple of entries relating to "PALATINE, the Subject Centre for Dance, Drama and Music of the UK Higher Education Academy".  I don't know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice?
