Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 14:
Text: Another admin has already deleted the article. Do you need me to restore it for you?

Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 17:
Text: Sorry to not reply earlier regarding Deathrockeru2014I've been away. Has the situation calmed?
Annotation from annotator: 22

Example 18:
Text: I see that he just re-added the old article in there at first, but by the time we got to the end, it was significantly changed.  Can you take a quick look at <url> and see if you think that version has the same problems?
Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 19:
Text: Hi, what was the image you are having problems with? Was it <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 22

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 21:
Text: It's not too long, certainly; but the extended quote does look a bit out of place there.  Perhaps it would be possible to move the bulk of the quote into the body of the article and leave a short phrase or two that could be inline with the second paragraph?
Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 22:
Text: Hi, that "Multics Virtual Memory: Concepts and Design" paper is already in the list of Multics papers (in the "Further Reading - Technical Details) - it even has the same URL! It only lists one source, though - perhaps the second could be added as an "(also here)" link?

Annotation from annotator: 0

Example 24:
Text: I've deleted the diagram from the <url> article because, as Curtis Clark points out in <url>, the diagram does not represent the results of the reference it purports to represent. Can't we reproduce an actual diagram from a published reference as "fair use" as long as we properly label & attribute it?
Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 25:
Text: You may want to take a look at <url>.  Can you be specific on what "spamming" is in this context?

For now, Celine's infobox says "CBS Records Canada (1986u20131990)", but since her discography owner/copyright holder is still Sony Canada, should I change this to Sony Music Canada (1986-present)?

Example 27:
Text: Josiah, believe me, I understand how you feel, and unless you really feel like it, I don't think you should involve yourself in the dispute, because it seems intractable. My question is more a procedural one: if an RfC doesn't generate consensus, and an edit war continues, what's the next step?
Annotation from annotator: 21

Annotation from annotator: 20
