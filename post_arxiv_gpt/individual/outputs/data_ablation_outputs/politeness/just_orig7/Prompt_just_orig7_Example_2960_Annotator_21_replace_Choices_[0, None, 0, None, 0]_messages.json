What's up with that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Maybe there is a cellar to the mill, which would count towards the five. Can you get a photo or two and add to Commons?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: Do you really think it is necessary to do that? Could you not simply take my advice on board?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: OK done. When do I get my money?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 6:\nText: Great work you've been doing on this. Would you agree with me that International Political Economy should be capitalised?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: What is the policy when someone writes something like <url> ? Does their IP get banned and their comment purged from the talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 8:\nText: I've made some improvements to <url>, keeping in mind your previous comments about the article. Since you gave its grade before, would you like to see it if it could be reassessed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: I'm responding here in an effort to keep the conversation in one place and would appreciate it if you would do the same. Did you see where I said above that images which only allow non-commercial use are still considered to be non-free?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: lol, turns out the photo isn't his either. Any ideas from here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: Stopped and removed. Could you pease be more specific when speaking of anti-Russian bias, with references to articles that you think they have?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: At the top of my talk page, it says, \"If I left you a message: please answer on your talk page, as I am watching it.\"  I think I already explained this to you.  Is there a reason we cannot communicate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 13:\nText: Basically, I agree with you. <url>, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: This is my first time at review-sorry if I blew it.  The article passes just fine--what do I do at DYK to indicate that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: Then I think that we need to be a little poetic, rather than the rather prosaic \"qualities associated with his weapons\". What about something like \"the magical properties attributed to his weapons\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: I see you've added <url> to the category \"Jewish-Canadians\".  What is your source for this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: Some of his categories seem rather POV to me, and it's rather obvious from his AfD participation that there's a disruptive streak afoot. Since you've got a bit of knowledge in the area, do they seem like the kinds of things which should be deleted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: Thanks very much indeed! :-) I don't suppose you'd fancy having a deadlink trawl over at <url>, would you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 19:\nText: And can you point me to a statement of that company where they say that they release their images into the <url>? Or can you provide proof that their copyright has expired?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: That's fine. Question: how did you find that out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 21:\nText: On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to do that <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: I didn't see your internal link, I put it back.  <url> isn't orphaned, what are you talking about?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 23:\nText: Well, that was an example as I am adding Infobox Historical American Political Party infobox to all those historical parties in <url> for which I was previously using the regular Infobox American Political Party until I found the Historical version in <url>.  So if I wish to continue, I will have to assign colors and shortname to all of them if not already done (like Anti-Masonic Party) right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: No problem. Have you seen the <url> article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: I'm not sure I understand what this has to do with what I said.  Could you restate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: Please answer Bishonen question to you. When were you invited to comment on UC related subjects?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 27:\nText: last msg ???\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: Can you respond to the comments I left on the S&M PR page please. If you are satisfied with the changes, can you tell me if it is qualifiable for FAN and if not for FAN, then for A class status?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: Hey, Rcej! ;) Would you be up to reviewing <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 30:\nText: Thanks, but I didn't see the 10,000 to 40,000,000 numbers there. Am I missing something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I looked at the quotations and they seemed aligned to me.  Is there something that I'm missing?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer corresponding to the label."
