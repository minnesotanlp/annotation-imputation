Would you please be willing to help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: May I say it this way: ''Even if the car always is known to be behind the same door,'' but if you make your decision \"at random\", ''even then'' your chance is 2/3 to have picked a goat. Okay?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 3:\nText: Well, actually I wanted to know if there were any errors in my own maps. ;)  Anyway, is the new map at <url> better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: Understood. Do you know of any legal expert you could contact to clarify this issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Well, I haven't seen a lot there, but the pages that I've seen were sourced. Does this mean you consider a sourced article in Wikipedia also unreliable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: E-mail me at <url> (just get rid of the spaces in between the letters and numbers) whenever you feel like it. By the way are you a member on any Iranian football forums online?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 7:\nText: Also, 'topological proof'? Isn't 'proof' a bit strong?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 8:\nText: Lists like this are a bad idea to begin with, and this one in particular has been deleted via an AfD. Why not try categories instead?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 9:\nText: I noticed that the A team article for Australia is at <url> instead of <url>.  Is that intentional, or something we should fix with a page move?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 10:\nText: You're welcome to revert edits, but I'm puzzled as to why you reverted this one - it seems absolutely essential to me the give a summary of Genesis 1. And if you revert Gen1, why leave Gen2?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 11:\nText: I have indicated on <url> that, should you be desyopped, I will immediately re-nominate you for sysop.  Would you accept the nomination if I did?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: Well... actually it is <nowiki><!--commented--></nowiki>. Could it be visible?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 13:\nText: <person>, with whom you discussed linkspam in 2006, has returned. Could you offer your views on his talkpage?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: User 86.138.232.97 does have a history of malicous edits. Are you then confirming that these malicious edits done by user 86.138.232.97 were done by yourself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 15:\nText: My concern about the article above still stands (re: notability). Now that it has been unmerged (against the AfD), will it be merged into the Begin articles as suggested, or will it have to be renominated?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 16:\nText: I'm a little surprised you haven't responded to my suggestions regarding the GAN yet. Is there some sort of a problem there, or have you just not managed to get around to it yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 17:\nText: I'm sure that this is not a useful place to discuss the merits of your topic ban, which I think would need a wider audience to overturn. Perhaps you could make a request to the arbitration committee?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: I personally cannot see why it is justified, well not from a quick perusal of his edit history anyway. Can you explain please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 19:\nText: I vote that they stay, given that even though they're not \"Recurring\" in and of themselves, they're part of a recurring phenomenon, which is Stephen doing \"Better Know a District\" spin-offs. So, maybe we should re-group them under a heading of \"Spin-Offs\" in the \"BKaD\" section?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 20:\nText: I'm always happy to give a second opinion on ID - you're welcome to put images on my talk page to discuss them. Regarding <url>, I would tend to go with ''<url>'', what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: Actually, I am concerned that you had completely removed verifiable facts of which I had included the references.  Would you please explain why you had removed the entire section I wrote on Collection Agencies in Canada?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 22:\nText: Hi Kathleen - It looks OK to me; all I did was change the template wording a bit and add parent cats to the stub category. What problem were you having?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 23:\nText: Please stop removing properly referenced information that I have added to this article.  This is an article that <b>YOU</b> nominated for deletion, so why are you even editing it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 24:\nText: Which of course is all the more ironic as my initial edits were an attempt to ''improve'' the article per <url>. Who the hell would have predicted all this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 25:\nText: Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I'm having a bad night, and all the theading... anyway, did I get them all?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: Hm. Are you asking to be banned?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 27:\nText: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 28:\nText: I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 29:\nText: Hey. I'm proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 30:\nText: BTW, I'm amazed that he has the gumption to show his mug after <url>. And do you have the balls (metaphorically or otherwise) to place a hatnote above his article linking to that term?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Hi, do you mind if I move your hook to go live on 26/27th? The GLAM WIKI conference could do with being highlighed by a non US/UK hook?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer and nothing else."
