Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 2:\nText: Go to <url> and create it like you would a page: just add a little text by putting in a little explanation at the top and adding categories u2014 see <url> for a basic category of this sort, although on a very different subject.  Let me ask, however: are you planning to categorise articles about schools and/or districts, or articles on the cities where they are based?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 3:\nText: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used \"on\".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: If the only page you've been visiting is Wikipedia, then it makes sense the viruses would come from here, but if you've been to other sites, they get thrown into the equation. Again, don't you have any anti-virus software?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 5:\nText: I'm disappointed that your first response here was to revert me without discussion, and to assert a consensus that was not apparent.  Before you choose to revert me again, can you ''please'' participate in the discussion at WT:RD?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 6:\nText: Thanks, I tried to do that but don't know how to do it? Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 7:\nText: I haven't. What are you referring to?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 8:\nText: I am out of YUBC (I wonder myself how can I even post here). Could you do it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 9:\nText: This is now ready for transfer. I will leave it up to you if that is OK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 10:\nText: And I'm asking for YOUR help, DrachenFyre, to control this vandal <url>'s changes to <url> and <url>.  What do we do with this nut?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: Thanks; it just occurred to me to cite USGS maps, but this is maybe even better.  Was there once an airplane crash in the vicinity, or are there maps like this for all parts of the country?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: How are these inconsistent with the traditional account of the origins of the Torah involving redactions as late as Ezra? Why do we need bizarre hypotheses about documents being interwoven that are contrary to all known examples of how books are written?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 13:\nText: \"Redirecting is blanking\" would be more accurate. Or maybe \"redirecting is redirecting\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 14:\nText: And why exactly am I looking at your monobook?  And why did you substitute your user links onto here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thanks. Anything else?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 16:\nText: I'm sorry, but that does not respond to my question at all. Should I take it to indicate a no?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 17:\nText: Actually, I think the only problem with linking the characters like this is that the underlining can be kind of distracting and the page can get a little harder to edit.  I wonder if there is some way to modify the Wikipedia software so that Chinese characters would automatically link to their corresponding Wiktionary page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 18:\nText: To be perfectly honest, I really have no idea what you're talking about.  Would it not be simpler to just ''add'' a link to the template (if that is indeed what you mean) than to create a potentially offensive and almost certain to be rapidly deleted category?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 19:\nText: Then why is the article for the monastery in Lhasa as \"Ganden\" instead of \"Gandan\"? Do both the monasteries have the same name?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: LOL what did he say in the press???\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: Is there any point to the quotation that's not served equally by the link on its own?  Other than the obvious (which I'd like to think you're above), which is trolling the student pollies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: What you really need to do if you want an article on 'Do Anything Nice' is to establish its notability. Can you find multiple non-trivial mentions in reliable sources that refer to it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: Hello - some of your writing is a bit hard to understand. Is English your first language, out of curiousity?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 24:\nText: Regrettably, I know little about <url>. Which dermatology-related articles have you seen me editing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 25:\nText: Not that clear to me. What's wrong with this username?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 26:\nText: Sorry about that. I guess instructions are there for a reason, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 27:\nText: He used it to assert that '''''others''''' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 28:\nText: Thanks for responding, at any rate. <smile> Protocol question, as I'm new here: If a discussion is unproductive, should one just delete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: Thanks for your response! How should we proceed ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 30:\nText: To ''Arbcom''? Aren't we being a bit dramatic here when other forms of dispute resolution have not been tried?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Please see <url>. Could you help with the list on the talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer and nothing else."
