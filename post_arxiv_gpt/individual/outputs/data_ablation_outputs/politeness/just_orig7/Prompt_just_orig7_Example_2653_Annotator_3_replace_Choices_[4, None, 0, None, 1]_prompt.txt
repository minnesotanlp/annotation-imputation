Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: What a joke, this player has played league football all his career and some clown has now deleted it off, what kind of rules has this been deleted under then?

Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 12:
Text: The YA article is a right trainwreck, and having had to do much of the exact same work on <url> and <url>, I'm not keen to do it again a third time on <url>, and then defend three separate articles from identical POV pushes. Thoughts?

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 17:
Text: Okay, so yeah, it's possible that that's his intent, but I even if it were, I don't see why the file has less value. Are interviews with BLP subjects not considered valid EL's general?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 21:
Text: "Overmans believes that the figure of 473,000 deaths listed in the 1965 German Church Service study is incomplete and not a definitive accounting of losses in the Expulsions" ? What is "Expulsions" here?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 22:
Text: Many thanks. I can't resolve "The work represents a summary of themes explored in Bacon's previous paintings", Tony's right - its clunky and unclear; any ideas?

Text: "Book" in question is A4 or thereabouts, and runs to a grand total of 32 pages including covers. It does state that it is a journal of SIAS, No 18 / 1988. There's not much to choose between the two templates though, is there?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 28:
Text: The 1980s Watchmen roleplaying module "Taking Out the Trash" has a section cowritten by Alan Moore and Ray Winninger; according to this http://www.capnwacky.com/rj/watchmen/noncomic.html it contains additional background info on the characters and additional insight; do you have the modules?

Target Example:
Text: I've removed my remark. But if somebody puts words in another's mouth, and that second person states that is not what he meant, and the first person responds that no, that ''is'' what the second person meant, well, wouldn't you say that's a little weird?
