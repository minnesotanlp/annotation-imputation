Examples from the dataset (there may not be any):Examples from the dataset (there may not be any)
Example 1:
Text: Per <url>, there was an autoblock affecting your editing that has now been lifted.  Can you edit freely now?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 2:
Text: I found <url> while working <url> from <url>, my first impulse was to give it a prod, an long unreferenced orphan without a clear reason to exist.  I see you are still active on Wikipedia, is there chance you can do something for this article?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 3:
Text: In retrospect "in as far away as" looks ungrammatical. Shouldn't it just be "as far away as"?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 4:
Text: Hey, so your move of this, and wanted to point out that the reason I put a disambig title on it, was because there are two different labor unions of the same name, either one of which could wind up with an article. But, I don't know that that means the article should automatically get the title, is there a standard for this situation?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 5:
Text: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?

Example 6:
Text: In your most recent edit to <url> you stated that the track in Clermont, Florida does not fulfill IAAF regulations (since reverted by another editor).  On what grounds does it not and do you have a source for that remark?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 7:
Text: Hey Nick, thanks for writing the book reviews! Would you like me to run one or both of them?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 8:
Text: Yeah I'd be happy to look at the list, however can't promise much! Shall we discuss it on the article's talk page so that any comments are in the relevent place?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 9:
Text: I thought that only section tags go into sections while the article tags go to the top of the page so they could serve it's purpose. Is there a Wikipedia guideline that can substantiate your revert?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 10:
Text: Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 11:
Text: Hi.  Is there anything I can do to help you utilize the spell check features of your browser?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 12:
Text: You may not remember doing this but, you erased a page entitled, Earl Newton.  Why did you do it?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 13:
Text: I think I do mark my pages patrolled. Doesn't Twinkle do it automatically?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 14:
Text: Your bot takes zh:u514bu91ccu65afu6258u5f17xb7u6885u7b56u723eu5fb7 off of the Christoph Metzelder page. What exactly is wrong with it?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 15:
Text: Is this something that is needed, even though most of the links are still alive? Is there a WP: page describing this and how to do it?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 16:
Text: In the article on <url>, you recently replaced a non-free image with J. Malcolm Greany's ''Ansel Adams and Camera'' on the basis that the latter image is in the public domain. How did you determine that this image is a work of the U.S. government?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 17:
Text: Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don't (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 18:
Text: I'm confused: what did you do?  And how did you delete it twice without restoring it in between?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 19:
Text: Thanks, the logo looks much better now. You wouldn't have a logo for the two predessesor clubs by any chance?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 20:
Text: Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 21:
Text: I noticed that you changed the formatting for <url> slightly, putting the links to 18-crown-6 and en to the sentence after the chemical structure rather than in the chemical structure itself. Why is that?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 22:
Text: After <url> <url>, all/most of the needs specified have been completed. Do you think its worth re-nominating <url> for FA or GA status?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 23:
Text: And <url> targets <url>. Shouldn't it go to <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 24:
Text: '''Question''' to both of you.  Would it be considered canvassing to notify every participant of the AfD of the discussion at <url> and ask for their input?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 25:
Text: Did you mean to also remove the Breitbart reference from the "Incidents" section?  Have I missed a meeting?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 26:
Text: This deleted page was recreated. Since you were the original nom., is this basically the same article, or has it been improved?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 27:
Text: You deleted Ricardo Marinello. What was written in the article?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 28:
Text: ''You wrote:'' I'm not trying to be obtuse, but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn't apply because the assertion of notability has been made?

Example 29:
Text: Jvhertum, Last year you made this change :http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Split-Second&action=historysubmit&diff=343316267&oldid=343252107 to the <url> article with the justification that "A is part of the name". This does not appear to be a valid reason to exclude it (<url> has a DEFAULTSORT of Beatles despite 'The' being part of the name), your thoughts ?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 30:
Text: There are a few posts at <url> saying people are having trouble seeing the DYK picture that's up now. Do you think you could switch it?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Target Example:
Text: In this <url> there was a loss of some info.  Was that intentional?
