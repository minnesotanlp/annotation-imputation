Or have you done some fancy trick with your signature to stop it linking back to your user page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Yobot labelled <url> as a stub, though it has <person>.

I don't know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 13:\nText: You blocked <url> earlier today: now we have <url> (<url>) (<url>).

There's not much to choose between the two templates though, is there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: I found <url> which is completely unreferenced but I could not find any confirming sources.

I have a question... how come you can't edit the article about Whales?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: Good job, great article. Where did you get the idea, out of curiosity?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 21:\nText: I found this talk page (and <url>) while deleting the user pages that you requested.

How about that protection?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 28:\nText: Thanks for the heads up, I don't think they will succeed but it's good to know they're planning it. Did you let Jayjg know as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 29:\nText: Any suggestions on what admin-specific readings I should be starting to go through, and what order?
