What was I doing wrong in the Italian films?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: I had a quick scan through the <url> article, which while good seems to be to suffer from the negative effects of \"summary style\" when used on very large topics - namely that while the individual sections are good summaries of what they are describing, the ''overall'' article lacks a coherent flow, a narrative taking the reader from beginning to end. Does that make sense?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: No problem, It was open and shut <url> issue. For your next project can you find something that doesnt make your fanclub at the Wikipedia Review angry?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hey, if you took this picture you can release it into the public domain. If not, do you know who took it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: Xandar, this Elizabeth II RFC represents the form of RFC I would like to use for the Catholic Church article. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 6:\nText: Forgive me if you've already done this, but...Could you post a list of the listing codes (such as DO, RN, etc.) for possibly non-listed properties with reference numbers?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: I've never played the RPG. What more information does it provide about Argos, Atlas, Julie, Ron, and the FISS Metas?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: Btw, I've issued a request for discussion on the Canadian Wikipedians' notice board about a dispute involving myself and another contributor on <url>. If you have a chance, could you look this over?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: Firstly, why do you assume I don't care about the content, and secondly, what chance have you given anyone to voice a dissenting opinion? Correct me if I am wrong, but you don't seem to have asked if anyone had a problem with the merge, did you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 10:\nText: The only books by Paul I was able to find were ''Concordia the Lutheran Confessions: A Readers Edition of the Book of Concord'' (Hardcover  - not yet released) and ''Communion fellowship: A resource for understanding, implementing, and retaining the practice of closed communion in the Lutheran parish'' (Unknown Binding - Jan 1, 1992).  Are those his scholarly works?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 11:\nText: Problem is how do you recognise the categories, as there are thousands of them. I have already made a program that scans the database, and can locate the unstubbed articles, so finding the untagged stubs is ok, and AWB automatically adds the stub tag if the article is short, I just can't think how you could program it to automatically guess the type of stub, any ideas?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: I'm also having to use your link.  Perhaps we should change the main page link to use the megaupload until we know that the main website is up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 13:\nText: Secondly, please show me where Maynard Smith credits this idea to Haldane.  Have you read the Grafen paper?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Thanks for the detailed reply.  Can a random admin who notices the image with the speedy tag do something useful to fix the situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thank you for telling me. Can you please revert my deletion, for I do not yet know how to do so?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 16:\nText: lol, turns out the photo isn't his either. Any ideas from here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hi Gareth. I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction for learning about building a wikipedia profile?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Wow, you waited a whole ten minutes. What's the problem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 19:\nText: I do not, nor have I ever used other accounts on Wikipedia. Didn't you ask me this before?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 20:\nText: At first I couldn't see it, but now that I've taken a closer look I see what you mean.  Now, I wonder, who was the first most decorated PR soldier in WW II?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: No problem.  :) Did you see the additional notes on the project talk page about the rest of those books from the 70s?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 22:\nText: As I said in the summary when moving him away from <url>, for the last twenty-six years of his life he wasn't a priest.

How do you like this closer crop?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 24:\nText: Did you discuss it with the user? Did you ask him/her to redact or remove it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 25:\nText: That explains some things, guess this'll take getting used to (not to mention the dozens of dabs I have to go back and re-fix). So, do you recall <url> by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: I'm going to remove it. Is that okay with you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: If it can wait until tomorrow, I'll look then. Could you provide diffs to the two threads?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 28:\nText: At the top of the page it characterizes a guideline as ''a generally accepted standard that editors should follow'' along with a passing reference to <url>. So, I might ask, how would using 4 tildes prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: As I have said before, it is an issue of breadth vs. depth. Are you familiar with such concepts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 30:\nText: Thank you for your answer. What are the sources for region 4 (Australia) release dates?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I wish I could say, but I don't know what it is.
