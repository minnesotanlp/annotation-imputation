Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 2:
Text: Indeed, the New York Times tells us that Iain Hook "''was shot in the back by an Israeli soldier ''". Why did a member of the IDF shoot him?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Text: I don't think so, Giano. Can we just once attempt to let this pass by without calling for the heads of people?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 4:
Text: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 5:

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 6:
Text: According to <url>, links are permissible as part of your signature but be sure to check the "'''Sign my name exactly as shown'''" box.  What happens when you load '''<nowiki><url><url> (<url>)</nowiki>''' into the signature window and check the box?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 8:
Text: Thanks for your additional categorizing. :) I guess I could just look at your contributions, but before catting, what "work" were you doing previously?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 9:
Text: Great job. Will it be done by next week?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 10:
Text: Are you talking about that I noticed that <url> wasn't in <url> even though <person> was changed to use <person> on 6 October 2010? And then did some script-assisted editing to remove <url> from a bunch of pages that had both the category and <person>?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 11:
Text: I state what I see when I read it.  Are you and <url> the same editor?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 12:
Text: I wondered, simply because I see you occasionally and had never seen him before, so at first I thought he was you.  I wonder if there's a User:Nyttned running around?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 13:
Text: Was working, so no. You?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 14:
Text: He's taken the notice down.  Doesn't this count as belaboring the point?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 15:
Text: I asked some questions in the Criteria for Inclusion section on 20th Dec but no-one has yet responded. Can you take a look?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 16:
Text: Oh, that's because I only copyedited a tiny section of the article. Should I still count that as a yes?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 17:
Text: Point taken. Would you like to be a mod?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 18:
Text: I am sorry, got confused on who created this article. :-/ Apologies?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 19:

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 20:
Text: It already look great. BTW, what are your thoughts about the previous post on the names of the other post office and rates lists?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 21:
Text: Wikipedia has a strict rule about ''not'' simultaneously filing an article in both a parent category ''and'' a subcategory of the same parent. Could you please ''not'' add <url> to a category if it's already in <url>, <url> or a country-specific record labels category?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 22:
Text: From the edit history to the template, it appears that your last edit has not been undone so hopefully this issue is resolved. You are both editors of between 1 and 2 years experience here, so perhaps a bit better communications would be a better approach in future?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 23:
Text: I've conceded on the infobox issue, but there are still some other outstanding issues, which I've addressed on the article talk page. Perhaps you would like to comment there?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 24:
Text: Okay, I asked for help at <url>, was directed to <url>. What do you want to do?

Text: What the hell? Bitter much?
Annotation from annotator: 0

Example 29:
Text: I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information. Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?

Example 30:
Text: Did make me smile....a dreamtime legend of a tiger in WA of all places. Seems a long way to walk, even when there was a land bridge ?
Annotation from annotator: 16
