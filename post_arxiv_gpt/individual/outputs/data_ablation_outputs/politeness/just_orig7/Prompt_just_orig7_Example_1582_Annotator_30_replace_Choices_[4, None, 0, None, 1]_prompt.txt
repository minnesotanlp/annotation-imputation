Text: Greetings, the Province of Alberta, through legislation, has designated a future highway that has an alignment and an assigned number, but has yet to be constructed. Is it premature to create an article on such a highway?

Example 2:
Text: Hello. Regarding <url>, could you tell me what supports this being a free image?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 3:
Text: The text of your warning <url> made me smile. Did you really think that if China got a new Prime Minister as of today, and a female one at that, it wouldn't be all over the news, and the link to this person would be red?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 4:
Text: -- Bit confused by your DYK nom.  Surely the world's first gasoline automobile was created by <url> four years earlier?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: Nice work.  :)  Got anything for <url> or <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 6:

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 8:
Text: GorillaWarfare- I don't know if you saw my reply on my talk page. Are you interested in being my mentor for the GU De-Ba'athification article?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 9:
Text: Jeff3000, thanks a lot for your help with the article.  But I'm just curious - why was the link to the article for "Advent of Divine Justice" deleted?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 10:
Text: Well, I bet you got that from stalking me. Are you making a template I can use?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 11:
Text: I've wikified this and added some categories. Any idea of his dates, and is he still alive?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 13:
Text: Re <url>, can you be more specific? Which IP address or range was blocked?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 14:
Text: I was told by a wikipedian that these following three sources are unreliable <url>. Is that true?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 15:
Text: Please see <url>. Could you help with the list on the talk page?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 16:
Text: Oh, Thanks. So I just need to put what articles I am going to be working on, and the coordinators will put my points on the scoreboard?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 17:
Text: I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information. Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 18:
Text: Your early edit's clearly indicate that you were not a newbie. How do explain this?

Text: I am planning on changing the <url> to the ICF Flatwater World Championships. Any objections?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 20:
Text: In any case <url> should have just been me saying "hey, could use some help" and maybe one or two short replies of "sounds good, I'll help" or "make sure you do XYZ", but instead TT2011 again tried to turn it into another discussion. Can we collapse it to save bulk?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 21:
Text: Im interested in where you got the information you added stating woodlands house was closed in 2003. As far as i can see your wording was taken from one website, the milesfaster one. Should you not cite the website you quoted rather than look for a couple of others?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 22:
Text: Thank you much! May I call upon you if I make mistakes or need help, then, please?
Annotation from annotator: 24

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 24:
Text: I was discussing this with Ling.Nut, since I've seen them around before.  What do you think of a founding member userbox for yourself, me and Ling?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 25:
Text: Alright then!?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Text: Excellent, thanks! I wonder if it's worth temporarily uploading a cropped image for the main page, as 100x100 is really very small?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 27:
Text: Umm... isn't the template page itself semi-protected? If so, then shouldn't it be in the category?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 28:
Text: No, I have not read it, as it is of no interest to me or this encyclopedia. Are you claiming that the references make the blog post a reliable source, or why are we still discussing this?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 29:
Text: <url>.. it doesn't really explain what the issue was. Can you word it better?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 30:
Text: I'm interested in why you reduced the columns from 5 to 2? Could you reply on my talk page please?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Target Example:
Text: Hey, I found <url> and at around 1:10, I think I can see the Backstreet Boys holding platinum discs (or double platinum, I'm not sure) for Backstreet's Back and Millennium. Can you please verify and is it possible to use this as a source for adding South African certifications?
