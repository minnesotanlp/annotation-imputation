In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Correct Examples:
Example 1:
Text: The <url> has a request (header "<url>") left a few hours ago by someone who has pictures of signs in China but can't read them.  Would you please be willing to help?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 2:
Text: May I say it this way: ''Even if the car always is known to be behind the same door,'' but if you make your decision "at random", ''even then'' your chance is 2/3 to have picked a goat. Okay?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 3:
Text: Well, actually I wanted to know if there were any errors in my own maps. ;)  Anyway, is the new map at <url> better?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 4:
Text: Understood. Do you know of any legal expert you could contact to clarify this issue?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 5:
Text: Well, I haven't seen a lot there, but the pages that I've seen were sourced. Does this mean you consider a sourced article in Wikipedia also unreliable?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 6:
Text: E-mail me at <url> (just get rid of the spaces in between the letters and numbers) whenever you feel like it. By the way are you a member on any Iranian football forums online?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 7:
Text: Also, 'topological proof'? Isn't 'proof' a bit strong?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 8:
Text: Lists like this are a bad idea to begin with, and this one in particular has been deleted via an AfD. Why not try categories instead?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 9:
Text: I noticed that the A team article for Australia is at <url> instead of <url>.  Is that intentional, or something we should fix with a page move?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 10:
Text: You're welcome to revert edits, but I'm puzzled as to why you reverted this one - it seems absolutely essential to me the give a summary of Genesis 1. And if you revert Gen1, why leave Gen2?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 11:
Text: I have indicated on <url> that, should you be desyopped, I will immediately re-nominate you for sysop.  Would you accept the nomination if I did?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 12:
Text: Well... actually it is <nowiki><!--commented--></nowiki>. Could it be visible?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 13:
Text: <person>, with whom you discussed linkspam in 2006, has returned. Could you offer your views on his talkpage?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 14:
Text: User 86.138.232.97 does have a history of malicous edits. Are you then confirming that these malicious edits done by user 86.138.232.97 were done by yourself?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 15:
Text: My concern about the article above still stands (re: notability). Now that it has been unmerged (against the AfD), will it be merged into the Begin articles as suggested, or will it have to be renominated?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 16:
Text: I'm a little surprised you haven't responded to my suggestions regarding the GAN yet. Is there some sort of a problem there, or have you just not managed to get around to it yet?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 17:
Text: I'm sure that this is not a useful place to discuss the merits of your topic ban, which I think would need a wider audience to overturn. Perhaps you could make a request to the arbitration committee?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 18:
Text: I personally cannot see why it is justified, well not from a quick perusal of his edit history anyway. Can you explain please?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 19:
Text: I vote that they stay, given that even though they're not "Recurring" in and of themselves, they're part of a recurring phenomenon, which is Stephen doing "Better Know a District" spin-offs. So, maybe we should re-group them under a heading of "Spin-Offs" in the "BKaD" section?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 20:
Text: I'm always happy to give a second opinion on ID - you're welcome to put images on my talk page to discuss them. Regarding <url>, I would tend to go with ''<url>'', what do you think?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 21:
Text: Actually, I am concerned that you had completely removed verifiable facts of which I had included the references.  Would you please explain why you had removed the entire section I wrote on Collection Agencies in Canada?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 22:
Text: Hi Kathleen - It looks OK to me; all I did was change the template wording a bit and add parent cats to the stub category. What problem were you having?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 23:
Text: Please stop removing properly referenced information that I have added to this article.  This is an article that <b>YOU</b> nominated for deletion, so why are you even editing it?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 24:
Text: Which of course is all the more ironic as my initial edits were an attempt to ''improve'' the article per <url>. Who the hell would have predicted all this?
Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 25:
Text: Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I'm having a bad night, and all the theading... anyway, did I get them all?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 26:
Text: Hm. Are you asking to be banned?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 27:
Text: I would specifically appreciate an outside view at the thread <url>.  What do you feel is the appropriate action?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 28:
Text: I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more?
Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 29:
Text: Hey. I'm proposing a <url> - would you be interested in coming along?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 30:
Text: BTW, I'm amazed that he has the gumption to show his mug after <url>. And do you have the balls (metaphorically or otherwise) to place a hatnote above his article linking to that term?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Target Example:
Text: Hi, do you mind if I move your hook to go live on 26/27th? The GLAM WIKI conference could do with being highlighed by a non US/UK hook?
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer corresponding to the label.
