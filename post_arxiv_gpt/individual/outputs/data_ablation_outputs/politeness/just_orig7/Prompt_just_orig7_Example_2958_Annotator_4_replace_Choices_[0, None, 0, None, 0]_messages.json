I guess instructions are there for a reason, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 2:\nText: Also, someone suggested merging it with another hoax page. Why wasn't that option considered?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 3:\nText: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: In my calculation if I got blocked that would only be good for me as it would clear my mind from the obsession to try and change that which seems wrong and mutable, but carries no private benefits for the reformer. Is that line of thinking truly alien to you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: My post above was a helpful hint about following DYK as a whole, not about the nomination process. Would you mind posting your post under a new heading, as it seems to have little to do with what I was saying and seems to be changing the subject?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: How about Guant who plays Pansy? Or Richard Fish who played Bill Weasley, and the actor who played Charlie Weasley in POA?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 7:\nText: But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''<url>'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm in Japan timezone - and at work now - and most IRC is totally blocked through work proxies.  Can we do a weekend?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks, but why specifically? Because I know the difference between ''hale'' and ''hail''?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 10:\nText: You are just saying that <math>frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</math> is continuous at <math>h=0</math>, but that is not the same as saying <math>f'(x)</math> is continuous. Do you have any references?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 11:\nText: I actually posted my comments a couple minutes ago.  Do you think that explanation works, or do you think it's a good idea I elaborate further?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 12:\nText: If it can wait until tomorrow, I'll look then. Could you provide diffs to the two threads?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 13:\nText: In what way do the GMTV images, such as <url>, conform with the guidelines at <url>? Where is the statement on the website saying that it is a press kit, and the images can be reproduced?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 14:\nText: Interesting illustration on the PrIze law page of a Zeppelin taking a Norwegian vessel as a prize in 1917.  I wonder whether you could point me to a source for more information on this incident?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: Don't worry about it. Take it easy, keep the ranting to a minimum and the productive editing to a maximum :) And you're still not convinced you should get an account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 16:\nText: There is current discussion pertaining to this at the Women's History project page <url>. Would you mind not templating BLPs until a consensus has been reached?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 17:\nText: Please do not make false accusations.  Where did he add a cn tag to a comment by a non-believer?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: What's with all the crap behind him? Was this at a signature desk?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 19:\nText: It should be deleted. Do you want to nominate it or should I?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 20:\nText: I have to protest that I find it rather meaningless to present arguments on the talk page for edits which are then blankly reverted by the likes of User:Historicar without explanation or discussion. Any suggestions for a more formal process or other remedies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 21:\nText: Good luck with the remaining time for your nomination. BTW: under what section on <url> do you think it should appear?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 22:\nText: Do you feel that you've had success in forming consensus here within your knowledgebase?  What do you feel are the underlying reasons behind your current ban from Wikipedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 23:\nText: Eh, thanks, Sometimes impressing is too easy. Do you want to review the windmill article above?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: There's nothing in your history besides editing my page, so I'm not sure to what you are referring. What page are you talking about?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 25:\nText: Actually, the page I am looking for is more like the equivalent of '''<url>''' here at en:wiki.  Do you know of such a page at nn:wiki?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: Cool, so you understand what \"subst:\" does now? Btw, eh, where are the section edit links on this talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 27:\nText: Hmm, there was a 7th <url> - but someone deleted him from <url> after removing the Prod. Is that kocher?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 28:\nText: <url>, whom you indefblocked almost a year ago, is requesting another chance and seems penitent. Have you any comments?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 29:\nText: I don't understand. So then you decide by yourself, and the people who stated their support for the original are ignored?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 30:\nText: Making edits vanish without a trace would be ''extremely'' difficult to do u2013 only full <url> could do that, and I can assure you the oversighters wouldn't do such a thing just to allow somebody to cover their tracks. Maybe you are mis-remembering something, about edits that were in fact on some other page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I'd love to help, but I'm not sure what you're asking me to look at, specifically. Is there a discussion ongoing that you can point to?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer corresponding to the label."
