How so - there's no 'v' in the Irish alphabet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: I noticed, that for users warned before, Huggle still uses level 1 warning. Is there anything I can do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've commented on this on the talk page. Could it be resolved there, rather than both of you just reverting each other?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hardly. Does the <url> exercise executive control over Northern Ireland?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 6:\nText: See my comment on the talk page. How did this ever get to DYK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 7:\nText: I don;t like commons because when i try to link things in the description it never works because it links only to commons. what is that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: I saw you removed the copyright CSD from Universum University as being \"unclear copyright status\".  What am I missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 9:\nText: You recently edited this page. It is my view that this page is just a corporate marketing listing, there are several hundred companies that do the same job yet are not listed in Wikipedia - Do you not think that this is advertorial?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Very well I won't contact you anymore. Geez, whatever happen to the spirit of collaboration?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 11:\nText: I've asked Jza84 if he could have a go at drawing a new plan, he's asking if we have any source material he could work from. The only one I can think of is the plan currently in the article, do you have any others?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 12:\nText: It's just, what becomes of <url>? Is the mention really there or not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 13:\nText: I note that you've edited since this was brought up here. Could you please respond?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 14:\nText: I had that fixed before you oranged me, I swears it! :) Are you not familiar with the technique of doubling your edit count using typos?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 15:\nText: Hello. Who are you, and when are we to have met or communicated in the past?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 16:\nText: How is the copyediting going? Do you still need a copyeditor?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 17:\nText: The notion that a hunter would kill dozens of birds with a single shot seems outlandish to me.  Do you have a reference for this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 18:\nText: That sounds fine, but why would you want somebody who knows nothing about the show to write them? If you are informed about it, wouldn't you be a good person to do it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 19:\nText: OK, maybe I only started noticing it after that incident.

This is the first time I'm seeing such a movement, if you wish to call it that... :) Have you seen something like this in the past?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: I thought this problem (non-Latin characters being changed to ??????? when people edit in certain browsers) had been fixed, but maybe there are browsers out there that don't support Unicode even with the fix?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: Maybe the ip adress is blocked???\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 25:\nText: Which of course is all the more ironic as my initial edits were an attempt to ''improve'' the article per <url>. Who the hell would have predicted all this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 26:\nText: Then why is the article for the monastery in Lhasa as \"Ganden\" instead of \"Gandan\"? Do both the monasteries have the same name?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: I have posted a question at <url> which you may be able to answer. Can you please return to that discussion to answer it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 28:\nText: Many thanks.
