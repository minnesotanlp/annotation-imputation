But let's make sure our answers are accurate by using <url> rather than something we heard someone say, eh?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 2:\nText: I'm not sure if you've changed your opinion of the article's FAC status, but I think you have guided us in a ton of good ideas.  Have you changed your opinion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: Well, yes, obviously (but I sort of assumed that the same exemptions would apply to 1RR as 3RR - is that not the case?) Should I self-rv?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 4:\nText: Steineresque! Shall I have a go, or will you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: Actually, if she is releasing a new single from the debut album, the title \"Home Run\" wouldn't encompass this. Someone else has changed it to \"Debut album\" which I think is more suiting, what do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: I think it's a great idea to get the CO3 community involved with keeping <url> correct and uptodate.  I shan't be there myself this year (clashes with various things) - would you be able to bring it up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Unfortunately I think <url> may also add that material; I am not familiar with Citizendum, though, but I will look at it. If Citizendum has the same policies regarding primary, secondary, and tertiary sources, then why not criticize both Wikipedia and Citizendum?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 8:\nText: Do you sign your name using 4 tildes? (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: You know, occasionally, Momoricks will send me a note telling how one of my snarkier edit summaries made her laugh. Is that the case for the triple-misspell revert I did?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 10:\nText: Emico, you have to understand that sometimes people use different words to describe the same thing. If I find a source saying \"Hitler killed himself\" and I write \"Hitler committed suicide\" am I wrong because the word ''suicide'' isn't in the sources?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 11:\nText: Are you sure that you want to withdraw your nomination to delete the 2 old articles? Don't you want the 2 articles deleted since they have been merged into something much better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 12:\nText: I know ''shin'' is one letter in the Hebrew alphabet, but the \"sh\" in English is a diphtong and there should be no need to transliterate the shin to SH. Have you seen this convention in any other articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 13:\nText: I agree with you in that this chapter has no place on <url>, moreover its inclusion there seems highly suspicious. Is there any way to see who added a particular word/sentence/paragraph without manually going through the history?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: I find it done both ways on the web.  If some convention requires capitalizing it even though it's not anything like a proper noun, I think that should get explained in the article, otherwise reasonable people will wonder who it's named after: someone named Saros, but what's his first name and where's the Wikipedia article about him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: Denied. I take it then that you deny responsiblity for an account (which I'll not name here) created just four minutes after you made that edit?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 16:\nText: I have put another warning on <url> with full details of the vandalism. Can this be reported to London Grid, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 17:\nText: These edits appear to be related to the same issue that caused the page to be protected. Could you please explain why you are doing this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 18:\nText: I've heard about the controversy. What's your take on it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 19:\nText: I remember your commenting on this about seven years ago.  What's your view today?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: I was just about to point that out. Is that permitted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: Are you both \"Dribblingscribe\" and \"Indiestu\" ? Do both those accounts belong to the same person?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: Could possibly be. Have you tagged any of the non-free images for review?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: This is my first time at review-sorry if I blew it.  The article passes just fine--what do I do at DYK to indicate that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 24:\nText: Thanks for the redactions :). Is it worth getting a third opinion at the reliable sources noticeboard vis a vis the use of law textbooks for points of law?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: How does it feel being wikifamous??\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: I'm gonna go ahead and do it. Thoughts before I proceed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 27:\nText: Thanks.  Is Brazil4Linux doing anything particully bad right now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: Noticed your nice ''<url>'' photograph. Perhaps you were on the Siruvani bird survey ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 29:\nText: You are obviously very busy. How should I proceed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 30:\nText: Why am I never asked to write a feature. Is it because \"I is black\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nText: Im sorry to see that you withdrew. Maybe next time?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
