When/where did that happen?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Was working, so no. You?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: It states on the page that it features her, they sample the song, and were going to try and get her to take part in the video... Surely this counts as being featured on the single?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 5:\nText: Is this, perhaps, what the main article calls a \"Backshot wheel\"? If so, should the article be renamed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 6:\nText: Hi, Michael David. Was there any consensus reached on this issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 7:\nText: Replied there. Should we keep it in that one place for now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 8:\nText: Both get across the same thing... the first is prettier. But, you at least agree with my edit removing the redundancies, no?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: From my reading of the entries, the Japanese force in <url>/South <url> & the <url> appears to have been the <url>, rather than the <url>.

How is the policy of \"you're not allowed to block someone for personally attacking you\" unworkable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: I saw you assess this with a B. What am I missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 12:\nText: 172 has refused to materially defend his take on NOR in terms of any criteria in <url> even abrasively deleting a query from a newbie on the subject in his talk page.  Is it possible to get some official clarification on the NOR policy before this becomes a precedent?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 13:\nText: Wow that's old! What do you think of <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: <url>, whom you indefblocked almost a year ago, is requesting another chance and seems penitent. Have you any comments?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 15:\nText: Respectfully, you've replied to the message below mine a day ago now. Could you provide guidance for my request please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 16:\nText: When someone tags articles using non-existent criteria, there's no way the articles should be deleted. The deleting admin has restored Reviewmageddon now, so it seems it's sorted out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: Stu: I have this terrible pain whenever I twist my arm around this way. What should I do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: You've been asking the ''sensible'' sysops...!?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 19:\nText: I have your CH2.js installed, but I forgot what it does.

Show me where I refuse to provide evidence backing up my changes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 21:\nText: What are your intentions after two months?  Will you continue your previous deletions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: Re your e-mail, there is info there which is not on my talk page. May I add it to my talk page, or would you prefer it stayed off?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 23:\nText: As for the Norwoods, both South Norwood and Upper Norwood are in Croydon, but West Norwood belongs to the LB of Lambeth.

I'll substitute ''tract''...?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 27:\nText: I might be able to help, but I don't really know the GA criteria though. What would you like me to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 28:\nText: Sorry Less? What is that last postdirected at?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: Another thing: <url> has created <url>. What do you think about it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 30:\nText: Hmm, there was a 7th <url> - but someone deleted him from <url> after removing the Prod.
