Who is he?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: Hi Skully, I've been keeping an eye on your edits over the past few weeks, and I think you should be a admin. Is it alright if I nominated you to be an admin?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 3:\nText: You may want to comment on the A7 to ?2 graph with 4 lines. I suspect it is nonsense - but what are your thoughts on that folding option?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 4:\nText: Was working, so no. You?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 5:\nText: Gosh, I didn't realise it was so many. Would that include 20 batches of DYK hooks (totalling 100 total hooks)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 6:\nText: I'm sorry, but there is no discussion on the talk page that indicates that there was a debate about renaming, so the keep vote stands, I'm afraid.  There were nine votes to keep, and only one to merge, so I don't understand how a single vote trumps nine others?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 7:\nText: I created the redirect page \"SEAC (computer)\" and I think the article chould go there, with redirects from the other two names.  Since you are an administrator, can you do that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm not sure if you've changed your opinion of the article's FAC status, but I think you have guided us in a ton of good ideas.  Have you changed your opinion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: I've been going through <url> and replacing the FiveHorizons.com refs (per Quadzilla99's comments). However, refs 39 and 40 don't seem to appear anywhere else; could you perhaps replace them with more reliable sources if you get the chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: \"''Images with iconic status or historical importance: As subjects of commentary.''\". Listen, it's just trivial to look up, could you take the care of actually reading these policies before arguing over them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 11:\nText: And can you point me to a statement of that company where they say that they release their images into the <url>? Or can you provide proof that their copyright has expired?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: While editing the COIN page regarding Ciplex, I accidently broke your sig. Since I don't want any more flame, could you please fix it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 13:\nText: Wanted to Email you about Wikimedia Converence Netherlands, but your email is not working. In any case, you could crash at our place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 14:\nText: Shane I reverted the edit you made this moring <url> but on second thought I would like some advice.  Is it implied in stub that they do not have references or is it appropriate to mark stubs as requiring a reference?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: I am not sure what are rules about GA in en.wiki but for me <url> is really outdated and it shouldn`t have GA sign. What you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 16:\nText: That sounds like they are just \"general use\" of the word, so in each article delink and (if needed) explain that, in this context, diaphragm means a divider - or just rewrite without the word diaphragm, or use a link to wiktionary. In fact, should linking to wiktionary be a standard way to clear up some of the links to dab pages?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: I just reverted your edits to the <url> page, because you seemed to make a number of major changes without providing an explanation for them, except the word 'Infobox' in your edit summary. Can you provide any references for the changes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 18:\nText: Oh, it's not that big of a deal. Drew, which IP edit did you consider to be \"attacking\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 19:\nText: I have addressed many of the points that you had brought up at the FAC, as well as many of the comments from other editors, some of whom have changed their sentiment recently to \"Support\".  Perhaps you could reevaluate your stance on the article, and see if you feel you could change your position in the current FAC?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 20:\nText: Take a look at the most recent post to <url>. Can you make a stub out of it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: M, I think we should put back the section that was archived yesterday. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: Indeed, the New York Times tells us that Iain Hook \"''was shot in the back by an Israeli soldier ''\". Why did a member of the IDF shoot him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: What is your opinion on just having that page deleted?  The spelling differences between that and <url> are more than minimal, as there are 4 differences between the two?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: What can you say about <url>, some of them are marked as stubs. Is it correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 25:\nText: Latest version (now on  Commons); all placenames included but still needs some tidying up and  tweaking. Comments?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: As a rough look over, the splits look ok to me (although yes, more discussion before forking is generally a good thing). If you think there are serious problems with them, why not just address it on the talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 28:\nText: I've had a look at it...I cannot make the height/width of the image any smaller because it will limit the number of towns I can add.  Therefore, is there any point to adding an atlas to wikipedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 29:\nText: Done. Does Adam Hunter need your disambig-style touch?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 30:\nText: Where is the exception in <url> for \"tossing out citations and verifiable in order to make it easier for the reader\"?  Who are you to disagree with Nikon's label of \"Compact Professional\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nText: <url>  Honestly, I'd like to know if you really are defending <url>.  Do you really believe that they were justified?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
