Example 1:
Text: Your closing statement in <url> has been cited as a <url> for the above AfD.  Can you make a comment in this discussion?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 2:
Text: Also, I was looking at the edit history for <url>, as I thought I had created the page (honestly I cannot remember), but the history prior to your move of the list to <url> is missing.  Do you know what happened to it?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 3:
Text: Yes, I posted a link to the history. I was asking/thinking where you stepped into the discussion and if you were editing as an IP and that would put a different slant on your 3rr warning to Bbb23?, have you been recently editing the article was the simple question?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 4:
Text: Hi, just noticed you reverted this page back to its pre-COPYVIO state.  Any reason you didn't use the content at <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 5:
Text: I find it hard to believe one editor (even one so prolific as RickK) can have much of an effect overall. Do contributors on either side have any (non-anecdotal) evidence that suggests otherwise?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 6:
Text: I'm highly in favor of "exposing Wikipedia's users" to these excellent pictures; that should go for ''all'' of Wikipedia's users, not just the ones who use this English edition.  What do you think: could we add a note to <url> encouraging people to put their FPCs on the Commons?

Example 7:
Text: Nice continued work on the expressway articles.  Is it possible to have some maps or schematic diagrams showing the location or routes of the expressways?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 8:
Text: Hey, I see you've been contributing! Time to lose the "leaving Wikipedia" box?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 9:
Text: You realize the bot maintains a separate page, right? Is it not possible that the "problem" is having the pages inconsistent?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 10:
Text: Don't worry I understand. Using igloo I assume?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 11:
Text: If you're not going to reply then I will undo the edit. Again, why have "Fictional martial artists" over the sub-cat "Anime and manga martial artists" and not use alphabetical order?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 12:
Text: Hi there again, just reminding you that the review must be archived over at WP:Biography as well, not only marked as such in the article Talk page. Do you think Markus's last concern was addressed to his satisfaction?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 13:
Text: Ideally, we add it to <url>, because that article is terribly bad, and this is a good starting point for a ''major'' part of it.  I assume the sources are not OR?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 14:
Text: What do you mean by "one edit war away"? And whats a siteban?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 15:
Text: You created <url>, there is already a page that similar <url>. Why don't you mix 2 articles together?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 16:
Text: Agree, it would need RFC. One question - should we set up 2 RFCs, as the RFC draft itself suggests - one for the general principle, and the other (separate) for specific REVDEL critieria which the community may or may not endorse, discuss, or make suggestions?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 17:
Text: No, Wikipedia does not consider itself (or wikis in general) as a reliable source. Surely you know such a basic policy?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 18:
Text: I tend not to be an RFC closer -- apologies. Hopefully someone else will?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 19:
Text: Hi - how's it going?  Do you need more time?
Annotation from annotator: 23

Example 20:
Text: I understand, it could be quite time consuming. Maybe we could do a collab for an article related to Thalia (once I'm finished with some work)?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 21:
Text: Could you clarify this? You're claiming that Betacommand knew before drama exploded onwiki that you were Pickbothmanlol, but did not share that with the community?
Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 22:
Text: You might want to look at <url> then. Should I do to <url>, <url>, <url> (and others) like you did to Jake Ryan (eg, removing words like "a" and "the" in the beginning of sentences)?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 23:
Text: Still at 1024 x 768 here '''Zangar''' and still looks fine to me. What about putting one of the images into the infobox using the piped 'static image=' parameter?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 24:
Text: I tried to create a similar map for Canada but couldn't get a usable output from the site you used for the Australia map. Could you create a Canadian one?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 25:
Text: Sorry about that. I guess instructions are there for a reason, right?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 26:
Text: I want to purchase a macro lens and was hoping for some guidance from you. Apart from being good in macro, can it be used to take good pictures of landscape and portraits?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 27:
Text: That should be good now. Except isn't it el-Senussi not El Senussi?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 28:
Text: They're back again - this time with IP 37.105.37.15 (also from Saudi Telecom Co DSL). Fortunately Jasper Deng stepped in - I presume they're an admin of some sort?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 29:
Text: Is the new draft at <url> OK with you? Do you have any comments or suggestions?
Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 30:
Text: I also have problems with a lot of the other recategorisation you have done to these articles, but I won't revert any more until I hear from you.  Taking <url> as an example: why have you removed it from <url> when it clearly is a linear filter; why remove it from <url> when it forms part of image parameter theory; why does an article which discusses electronic designs not belong in <url>; why remove it from <url> when, obviously, it is a term?

Text: Interesting.  Would you mind asking at which Sae Gae seminar on what date it was taken?
