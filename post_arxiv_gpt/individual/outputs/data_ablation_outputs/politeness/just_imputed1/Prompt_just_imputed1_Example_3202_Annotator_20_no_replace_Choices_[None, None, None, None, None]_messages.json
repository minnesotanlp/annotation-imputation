How should I spell priviledge and appologise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 3:\nText: I was wondering why you removed him from Category:Alameda. He's pretty famous around there and it would be notable to have him in the category of Alameda, wouldn't it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 4:\nText: Then why is the article for the monastery in Lhasa as \"Ganden\" instead of \"Gandan\"? Do both the monasteries have the same name?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: 89.243.201.235, another account from him to just deleting sections at wimbledon. Canxb4t you protect the page for two weeks?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 6:\nText: I'd like to ask why you're so insistent on creating a page called <url>, which means the same thing as <url>.  Are you disagreeing that they mean the same thing, do you feel that the <url> article is bad, or do you feel that <url> is a better name for the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 7:\nText: I know that this has been discussed before by various editors, but can anybody give me a reason why the problem is normally formulated in terms of the door numbers (1,2,3) and not the objects behind the doors (the car, goat 1, and goat 2).  Is this just because the door are given numbers in the problem statement but the goats are not given names?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm finding that I'm not able to access any of the DPL-related pages on the Toolserveru2013I get an error message or a blank pageu2013but somehow the Dab Challenge results are still being updated by your bot. Do you know what's going on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 9:\nText: Okay.  Is that a tacit admonishment of the merger chaos created by user Lucy-marie?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 10:\nText: I agree it is a bit hectic how active the conversation is. Would you like to take it to #wikipedia ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Is there any reason that you redirected <url> to <url>? Did this happen as a result of a technical error or something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: One deleteable article at a time, please.  This is a <url> G4;  do you agree, and if not, why not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 13:\nText: I have advised past attendees of this discussion. Does the last weekend of October work for you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 14:\nText: Just letting you know (since you have mentioned AFDing <url>) that weu2019ve gone to some effort to establish notability with <url>, and have added three reliable, notable, third-party sources to the article.  Do you feel these sources establish <url> as being notable (<url> and all that)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: So you see KV, just in case you missed the point, you are in the naughty chair in the naughty corner because of your own baloney, baloney that you bring yourself.  Now, didn't you like that story?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 16:\nText: PS, we are having a discussion about such a new criterion at this moment - see <url>. Rather than ignoring the policy because you think it broken, why don't you join in with the discussion to make it not broken?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: Where is the vandalism? Diffs?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 18:\nText: You created <url>, there is already a page that similar <url>. Why don't you mix 2 articles together?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 19:\nText: Thanks, was getting worried there for a moment. Have you though of asking Outriggr for a hand with <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 20:\nText: They all used to be dabs that linked to other dabs which are now housed in the pages I moved them to, so I don't think there's too a need to restore them. Also, I eliminated the \"4th of July (song)\" redirect as there was only one page linking to it; no use for a redirect if nobody is going to it, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 21:\nText: Thanks! Do you know why this was held jointly and what was worked on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 22:\nText: Email from the Darkshado guy complaining about you adding him to the spamlist. I searched the site and couldn't find any of our articles replicated there; has he removed them, or what?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 23:\nText: You may need to enable your own setting to allow E-mail too; I'm not sure. If so, maybe you can turn it on temporarily, so that you can send me one e-mail?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: Don't you think it's taken too far back to be of any use? Do we have any alternatives?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: I am not sure why <url> is not just in the article <url> as a straight table. Is there some chance the template might be used on another article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: But the template didnxb4t refer to any problems. What are the problems?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 27:\nText: And what about <person>? Does it need fixed now too?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 28:\nText: And, in case I forget, it is what happens when I sign with four tildes. See?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: What's up with all those tweaky changes?  Just salting redirects?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 30:\nText: Hi there, I've raised the possibility of unprotecting the tamazepam page <url>. What are your thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nText: I wish I could say, but I don't know what it is.  Could you tell me a little more?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
