I can't see any advantage to having this crap floating around for 5 days - can you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 2:\nText: Certainly the work is out of copyright, and some of the neighboring volumes in the series are visible on archive.org (and I don't have trouble with other books on google generally).  I wonder if you know of any way, or could suggest any way, that I could get to see the downloaded pdf of Newcomb vol.6?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 3:\nText: I went to WP:VAND and looked up sneaky vandalism. To qualify for the reward, does it only have to qualify as sneaky or does it have to be \"extra\" sneaky?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: I think the story is worth recording, and I could add several more references.  I have to ask... are you related to Boyds, Smileys, or Souters?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: Since your tube station articles don't actually contain any information, what is the point of them? Why not put them together and work them into an article that says something interesting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 6:\nText: The Hitchin-related hoax claims by <url> seem to have led to a rather precipitate response, considering that he has only been an editor for a few days.  Is there something going on here that isn't obvious?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 7:\nText: clear about when the inverse exists.  Is there a formal theorem that would apply?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 8:\nText: This is irritating. What browser are you using?\nAnnotation from annotator: 2\n\nExample 9:\nText: Why did you revert my edits on that page? You say it was unsourced but it was sourced, I put two references to two fair sources (not blogs nor politicaly bound), so why did you remove them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 10:\nText: Good work on the canal junctions! Where appropriate, do you think we should give the nearest pedestrian access point, from the road (as opposed to canal) network?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 11:\nText: Should I move it myself, or would you like me to walk you thru it? Have you read <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 12:\nText: I noticed you've put in quite a few posts in the gun politics talk pages. I'm just wondering do you have an interest in firearms or just the politics behind them and their use?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 13:\nText: Was this wholesale revert really necessary? <url>  Did the edit completely fail to improve the article in any way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hi Steve, I've added refs & cites to this article. Do you think it still needs a warning about lack of refs/citations?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 15:\nText: Can I ask why you deleted this AfD as \"A3: Article has no meaningful, substantive content\"?  It obviously did have meaningful content; was there any reason it couldn't simply be closed like any other AfD?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: See <url>. I assume you didn't mean <url> ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 17:\nText: Yes, you get all kinds of people coming to visit. Which seat are you in?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 18:\nText: Thank you. Do you have any tips on the Kathy Dunderdale article to improve it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 19:\nText: I don't think removing that info is the correct fix. Just change the punctuation... OK if I do so?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: Hi Zaps, thanks for adding a source to the timetable as a reference for the destinations served. But how do you know that Sharjah and Istanbul are operated as charter flights?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 21:\nText: I very much disagree that the article that was deleted was advertising; I have never bought anything from his store as a matter of fact, but I do know that his is one of the most used online Judaica shops out there. What can I do to make the article acceptable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 22:\nText: One question - how come the page is marked as \"in dispute\"?  The data that is currently posted isn't in dispute, correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 23:\nText: <url> is a validly notable topic which has been ruthlessly  suppressed at WP, probably because of egoism rather than religionist POV warriors but possibly both. Can you advise me on how to go about appealling deletions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 24:\nText: I was thinking about creating a page about Nintendo eShop. And since you are a well trusted user I am asking you if you think that would just be deleted because there isn't enough information?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 25:\nText: I pretty much agree with <url>, except I would like to know why you modified the see also section to be a hatnote. Doesn't <url> have specific requirements for this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 26:\nText: Thanks for pointing out that \"undiscussed moves\" discussion, I hope something comes out of that - but it doesn't really look like it will.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for on the discussion page for <url> about this, what am I missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 27:\nText: I must be missing something here.  Would you mind clarifying for me the nature of your extensive work on <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: I think I updated the pharmacology project banner to put C-class articles into the appropriate category (previously, it was putting them into the unassessed class. If you want to double-check, that would be great; I think it may take a little while for it to update the articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 29:\nText: I moved '''Engine Arm Aqueduct''' to <url>, because there seemed to be much more content about the canal than the actual <url>. Does that seem reasonable, to you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 30:\nText: You removed the border issue coverage in <url>, and your explanation was that it's covered in another article. Where is it covered?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nText: <url>  Honestly, I'd like to know if you really are defending <url>.  Do you really believe that they were justified?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
