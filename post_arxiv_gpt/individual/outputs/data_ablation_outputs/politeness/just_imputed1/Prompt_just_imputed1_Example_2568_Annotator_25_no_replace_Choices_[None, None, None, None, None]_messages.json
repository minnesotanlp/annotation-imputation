I'm wondering if you're willing to coordinate the project for a while?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 3:\nText: Problem isn't too hard; I'm taking care of it.  Had you discovered <person>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: What are your intentions after two months?  Will you continue your previous deletions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I'm looking for a diff by yours where you compared administrator corruption to what happened to students during the <url>. Do you happen to know where is that diff?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 6:\nText: LOL what did he say in the press???\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: Done, I think. How does that look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 8:\nText: On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you.

Every other list and article on space travel uses the altitude definition, why would the sub-list sorted by nationality be different?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 10:\nText: Point taken. Would you like to be a mod?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Yellowmonkey has told me we need another FAR delegate and recommended you for the job. Is that something you're willing to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: JoJan, not got a picture of one yet, but I notice in you wrote that it is rare.

Are you sure this had to be a speedy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: Turbinella is a disambiguation page. Perhaps perform a move to Turbinella (gastropod) ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 17:\nText: I didn't have those in <person> because they were already included under the tributaries categories. Is this one of those \"basketball player\" exceptions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 18:\nText: Still, I cannot understand why virtually all boxes related to the EU were removed. What makes this issue more divisive than for example the re-unification of Yugoslavia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 19:\nText: Also, how does that vandalism thing on your page work? Do you have to change the count manually, or does it detect vandalism itself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: I'm not seeing it. Has it been fixed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 21:\nText: On second thought, the mix of pseudo-politeness, vulgarity and threats is...really creepy. Could ya...stop?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 22:\nText: All right, I'll bite.

Why are you adding a red link to the vandalism page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 25:\nText: Fair enough, thanks for assuming good faith, I was merely making the page consistant with the past 2 champions league season articles (<url>, <url>) which use path and non-champions instead of route and league. Should they be changed too or was that what they used to be called?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 26:\nText: Yes I can. Is it an alternate account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: Why are capital letters used in the article title ''<url>''? Is this a proper name of a particular proprietary software package?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: Incidentally, your username seems familiar. Do you contribute to SPGB-related forums by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 29:\nText: I was aware of that part of <url>, but I don't see its relevance here. Do you say that considering the audience is an arbitrary standard?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: oh, my, how did I get this here twice; trying to do too much at once (what else is new).  Can you copy instead a different color?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nText: Greetings, I ran across your 2008 article <url>, and the footnotes are done manually vice the usual Wiki way.
