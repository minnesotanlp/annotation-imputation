This is kind of weird for me but I see that you are a participant in the photo project and list yourself as a photographer in Edinburgh and I was wondering if there was any possibility that you would be willing to respond to my recent request <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 2:\nText: Thanks for the heads up, I don't think they will succeed but it's good to know they're planning it. Did you let Jayjg know as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 3:\nText: Is there a <url> for these? How should I spell priviledge and appologise?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: If you keep your eyes focused on the moving toe you can usually catch each instance when you change the rotation direction, I think? Does that tell you anything?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 5:\nText: The content has recently been added to <url>. Would you consider changing your vote to delete?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: Hi I saw you mentioned that DirecTV has plans to add MSNBC HD upon launch on <url> but the source you referenced has nothing about DirecTV in it, its just about the HD launch itself, so I removed it per <url>. Do you have a source that specifically says DirecTV WILL add it upon launch?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hmm, there was a 7th <url> - but someone deleted him from <url> after removing the Prod. Is that kocher?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 8:\nText: that hotcat lockup, was like an edit conflict, so i tried a backup and re-enter.  thanks for the assistance, i'm using the old layout, so would the new view affect my hotcat category edits?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 9:\nText: The review has been up there for something like six weeks, I notice. Think you'll be able to take care of those last couple of things?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 10:\nText: Do you see any that are missing? Is this what you wanted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 11:\nText: The article doesn't seem to imply that ''The Game Keeper'' was created by WotC, nor does it give a hint when the company bought the stores. Were you thinking of something specific I can change to make that more clear, or is it fine as-is?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 12:\nText: I see that you closed that CfD discussion as rename, but haven't actually renamed the categories. What's up with that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 13:\nText: You created this template, but it is only used in one article. Do you intend to expand its use, or is it not required?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 14:\nText: If you can remember, would you mind giving a bit more information about this photo e.g. where you took it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information. Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: I'm attempting to be incisive, and the articles integrity hasn't been disrupted. Therefore i see no reason why you chose to comment unless you felt that ive wiped out important information?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 17:\nText: A wikipedia project that serves as a place where users can get signatures, userboxes.... stuff like that, so they don't have to make it themselves or ask a specific user to do it. What do you think of that idea?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 18:\nText: Can we hear this from Counter-revolutionary? Perhaps in conjunction with a rebuttal, rather than just a denial, of the allegations?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 19:\nText: Thanks, was getting worried there for a moment. Have you though of asking Outriggr for a hand with <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 20:\nText: I was doing some minor editing on this, and noticed that the date of death in the intro and infobox don't match. Could you take a look at this and see which is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: Okay. What, exactly, can I do about that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 22:\nText: I've been trying to convince this user that his only problem is his username, but he doesn't seem to fully believe it.  Would you mind popping over and giving a word or two of encouragement?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 23:\nText: I could take a peek, at least.  What problems are you having?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 24:\nText: I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding your question. Could you try again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 25:\nText: I very much disagree that the article that was deleted was advertising; I have never bought anything from his store as a matter of fact, but I do know that his is one of the most used online Judaica shops out there. What can I do to make the article acceptable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 26:\nText: When I look at the stats on the <url> wiki page I only see 55 Major appearances from 1972 onwards. I'm going by the assumption that page is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 27:\nText: Not to worry. What's \"D.M.\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 28:\nText: Well, I bet you got that from stalking me. Are you making a template I can use?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 29:\nText: Should I move it myself, or would you like me to walk you thru it? Have you read <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: Are you saying you have never edited as anything else? What brought you to that particular article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nText: Where is the exception in <url> for \"tossing out citations and verifiable in order to make it easier for the reader\"?  Who are you to disagree with Nikon's label of \"Compact Professional\"?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
