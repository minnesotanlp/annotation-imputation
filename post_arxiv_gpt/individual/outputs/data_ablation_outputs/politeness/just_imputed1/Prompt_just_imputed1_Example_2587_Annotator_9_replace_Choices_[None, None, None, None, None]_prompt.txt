Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 7:
Text: I don't follow.  Can you address the above with regard to why it ''shouldn't'' be speedily deleted, as a recreation of deleted material, and as a content fork?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 8:
Text: This is what you wrote: "In the book 'Inventing Elliot' written by Graham Gardener, the book, 1948 is mentioned numerous times." What book, 1948??
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 9:
Text: It was for closure's sake, as to show that the debate was closed and that was the result, the user was '''blocked''' and the userpage was '''deleted'''.  Doesn't that show you the items better?

Text: Thank You. What is "The Prince of Santorini" anyway?
Annotation from annotator: 18

Example 11:

Text: I am willing to try to discover the problem. What browser do you use?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 19:
Text: TimPF - I don't see the objectives as mutually exclusive, the previous creation of the Suburban Rail stubs by others took the content in a direction which I am reinforcing with these edits which fill out the stubs and bring a bit of consistency within the Suburban parts of RTIL.  PRTIL could fulfill a similar function for mainline services perhaps?

Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 16

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 25:
Text: OK, I'll bite. How is ''Matt "Dirty" Sanchez'' to be construed as anything other than a personal attack?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 26:
Text: <url> and <url>, both created  by you, seem to be mostly overlapping but are not identical.  Presumably one should be a redir to the other?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 27:
Text: I remember your commenting on this about seven years ago.  What's your view today?
Annotation from annotator: 12
