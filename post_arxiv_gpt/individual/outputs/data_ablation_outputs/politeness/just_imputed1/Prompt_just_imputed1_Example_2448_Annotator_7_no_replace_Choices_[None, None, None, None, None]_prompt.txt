Example 2:
Text: Lil-Unique told me it with the reasons of what I put in my edit summary, so if you need a better explanation ask him. I left Billboard Hot 100 as Billboard Hot 100 because that's the exact name of the chart?

Text: I'm linking this to Fumiyo's. Are <url> and <url> among the bullies too?

Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 7:
Text: You added partisan colours for the early Chancellors (such as a conservative blue colour for Bismarck); as the early Chancellors were not attached to any political party, and the "party" given is merely an approximate indication of their political leanings, I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Also, why did you remove the partisan colour from the last part of the table (the Republic)?

Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 11:
Text: Um, I'll check it out, 141.158.210.110, but I haven't had a lot of edits (if any) on that article. In the mean time, why not <url> and join the Wikipedia community?

Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 14:
Text: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 21:
Text: Hi, although I agree with you, please check the following <url> in process. Why can't the darn thing work, in the first place?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 22:
Text: You're right, but loosing it because of Devanampriya, of all users, would be quite a shame for Wikipedia. Don't we have to make a stand against ignorance, partisan POV-pushing and constant incivility?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 23:
Text: What do you think? Is there a mistake somewhere?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 11
