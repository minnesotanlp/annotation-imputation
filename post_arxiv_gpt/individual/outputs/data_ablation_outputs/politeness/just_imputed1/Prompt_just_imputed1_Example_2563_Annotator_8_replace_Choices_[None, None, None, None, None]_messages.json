He begin the edit war again, as seen by diffs, so C was blocked instead of direktor, see?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Understood. Do you know of any legal expert you could contact to clarify this issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: I see. So what should I do with this sockpuppet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I also found your audio uploads at <url>. If it's not a burden, would you mind recording more Hungarian town names for WP?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: Very well.  What is your figure for annual worldwide hysterectomies?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: And  what did I do wrong???????????????????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: What you really need to do if you want an article on 'Do Anything Nice' is to establish its notability. Can you find multiple non-trivial mentions in reliable sources that refer to it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: Well, I haven't seen a lot there, but the pages that I've seen were sourced. Does this mean you consider a sourced article in Wikipedia also unreliable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: I see that you are becoming a little bit paranoid. Do i need to do a check user for you ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 11:\nText: He's still at it, and stating that we can't stop him as he has not got a static IP. Can you at least block him for now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: Can you explain what you mean by ''\"Randi, paranormal, Larry King etc. are all redundant redundant\"''?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 13:\nText: FYI, I found a unit representative, I think, see <url>. I directed him to your draft for the military reps, would you mind supporting him if you need, I am kindof wrapped up in several different things off wiki and on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 14:\nText: Incidentally, the bot had to sign the message you left for me! Four tildes, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: Inch es gartsum? <url>...do you have email by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 16:\nText: Those of us who've been here the whole time are pretty incredulous about it also. :)  We miss your fine editing style and hope you come back sometime -- keep looking in on us now and then, at least?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 17:\nText: Well the only plausible explanation was that you reverted to where I removed an extraneous cat (after Homestarmy's edit) and then swapped out a template... but as you're a competent editor that just seemed odd. Is that what indeed occurred?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 18:\nText: Qui tacet consentire videtur?  Do we have \"consensus\" on this yet, or is an RM required?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 19:\nText: Would you like to elaborate? How are you empowering me exactly?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: Sorry I got called away.

Be bold?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 22:\nText: Hmm, now I feel ignorant. Are you aware of a good source we could stick in the article to back this up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: Btw, I've issued a request for discussion on the Canadian Wikipedians' notice board about a dispute involving myself and another contributor on <url>. If you have a chance, could you look this over?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: Why am I never asked to write a feature. Is it because \"I is black\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sorry, I was wondering if the are related to each other or separate organizations? Also is there a difference between North Twillingate and Twillingate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 26:\nText: I've never played the RPG. What more information does it provide about Argos, Atlas, Julie, Ron, and the FISS Metas?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: You're acting very oddly today: You've just reverted two separate edits on <url>, saying they were the phrasing of the Lancet, but neither references the Lancet, and it seems unlikely that both would have the same statement applying to them. Have you been hacked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: Oh, yeah, I've heard of that--that was the issue the Colonel was (incorrectly) alluding to, right?  Is that list to which your link sent me something that Steve had to create, or was it generated automatically?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: I'm afraid I don't entirely understand what you mean. Is there some conflict with using user authorization and the GPL license?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: BTW, I'm amazed that he has the gumption to show his mug after <url>. And do you have the balls (metaphorically or otherwise) to place a hatnote above his article linking to that term?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nText: Apologies again, though. If I tell a fart joke, will you forgive me?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
