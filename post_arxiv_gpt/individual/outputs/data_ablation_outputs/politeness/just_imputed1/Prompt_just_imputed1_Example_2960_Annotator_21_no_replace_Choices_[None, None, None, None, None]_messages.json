Do You have a better suggestion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 16:\nText: Unfortunately, I have no clue what you mean.  Can you point me to a page that has such a feature?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: Thanks, the logo looks much better now. You wouldn't have a logo for the two predessesor clubs by any chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 18:\nText: Can I also point out that the text that you pasted into Wikipedia is entirely inappropriate for an encyclopedia article and at best will require extensive editing to conform to the<url>.

Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 29:\nText: There may not be a lot of situations like this, but there will definitely be some.
