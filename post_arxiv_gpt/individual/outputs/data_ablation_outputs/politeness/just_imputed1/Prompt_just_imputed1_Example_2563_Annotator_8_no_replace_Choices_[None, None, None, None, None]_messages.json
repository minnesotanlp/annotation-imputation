Is it implied in stub that they do not have references or is it appropriate to mark stubs as requiring a reference?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 3:\nText: sir.. can i still write an article? do you have any facebook account?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 4:\nText: OK. In the future, can you kindly post a note on your userpage, talkpage, or somewhere else so I know that the bot isn't broken?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi - there are a few issues that I've pointed out at the nomination page. Also, why does your sign link to the talkpage of <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: It does not appear to have attracted any participants other than Gerda. Perhaps adding a <person> template would draw in more participants?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 7:\nText: I have reverted your relocation of the images of this fragment - as I think it better if the images and transcripts can be seen side-by-side.  Do you agree?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: I have moved the navbox and the noinclude of the <url> to <url> because it would be stupid seeing an article called Template:PDC Top 16 when it is showing the top 20 players. Your thoughs?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: In short, based on the sparse information provided by outsiders, I would like to work constructively with you (and others) to whip the article into shape, as its presence seems warranted but the article is unlikely to garner necessary details from random contributors.  What shall I do next?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 10:\nText: Go to <url> and create it like you would a page: just add a little text by putting in a little explanation at the top and adding categories u2014 see <url> for a basic category of this sort, although on a very different subject.  Let me ask, however: are you planning to categorise articles about schools and/or districts, or articles on the cities where they are based?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: That's a couple levels of automation beyond my experience. But if you just got the idea today, then how can you know the false positive level is low enough for WP:AWB/Typos?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 12:\nText: So argument that \"''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''\" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 13:\nText: I was wondering why I couldn't edit the list of micronations article to correct the alphabetical order. was I blocked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hi, thanks for letting me know about my signature not being linked. I tried to save the settings in preferences - did it work?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 15:\nText: How exactly is it unclear? The ships link to the same place, the prefix \"HMS\" comes before ''Eagle'' to show her name change... what's not there that should be?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 16:\nText: The article already says where they come from in the ''birth location'' field. What's the point of repeating it, especially at the expense of other info?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 17:\nText: Sure. A redirect how though?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 18:\nText: You're a math teacher, right?  May I ask what grade level?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 19:\nText: Just curious. Does the '''tab''' key move your cursor to the search box?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 20:\nText: A quick question, I'd like your opinion on something. Do you think I should put <url> GAN on hold or fail it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: Could you please explain <url> to me? I don't see how deleting a person's userpage is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: I permit myself to bring your attention about the edits of <url> (16 november) who is removing the name <url> from all the articles of wikipedia. What can be done ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: What do you think? Is there a mistake somewhere?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 24:\nText: I would like to first thank you for coding the afd helper app. Secondly, is it possible it could be changed to work with other XfDs?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 25:\nText: Hey Nick, thanks for writing the book reviews! Would you like me to run one or both of them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 26:\nText: Can I ask why you deleted this AfD as \"A3: Article has no meaningful, substantive content\"?  It obviously did have meaningful content; was there any reason it couldn't simply be closed like any other AfD?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 27:\nText: It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided.  Do you have any references you can add to the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 28:\nText: I dont use AWB so im doing it manually. Is that a problem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 29:\nText: You assume correctly; same principle would apply. :-) By the way, is there a trick to getting the (Talk) link in your signature automatically that I haven't learned yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 30:\nText: Some pictures are not mine, but those that I have changed, their own. And you can submit a complaint the owners of those photos?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nText: Apologies again, though. If I tell a fart joke, will you forgive me?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
