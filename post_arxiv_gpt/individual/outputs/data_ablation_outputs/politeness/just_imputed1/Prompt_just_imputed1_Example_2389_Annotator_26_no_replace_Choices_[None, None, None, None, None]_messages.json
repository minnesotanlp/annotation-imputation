How did this ever get to DYK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: Without participating in talk page discussion, you have deleted reliable sources, and rewritten a sentence so that it is supported by no sources at all except your personal opinion.<url>  Am I missing something here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 3:\nText: The article <url> is vandalism. Could you please delete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 4:\nText: Wow, thanks for pointing that out. I'm having a bad night, and all the theading... anyway, did I get them all?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: I guess there's a connection to <url> too. Do you think that's cu worthy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: COI? What COI do you think I have?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: You seemed, to me, to be addressing all of us who were opposed to your merger. Do you know a different meaning for \"oddwater\" other than \"urine\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hi, just noticed you reverted this page back to its pre-COPYVIO state.  Any reason you didn't use the content at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks; it just occurred to me to cite USGS maps, but this is maybe even better.  Was there once an airplane crash in the vicinity, or are there maps like this for all parts of the country?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 10:\nText: Thanks. Do you feel the information is \"weak\" or is it just too complex?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 11:\nText: Thanks terribly for looking it up. Would it be alright for me to use the new source in Europe, economy section then?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hi Awadewit,  I hope I've started a discussion at <url>?  Would you like to weigh in there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 13:\nText: Did you see JzG <url> James Cantor that his alleged COI prohibits him from editing any BLPs related to his academic field?  Didn't the AN discussion after the last round actually repudiate JzG's stance on this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 14:\nText: Since your tube station articles don't actually contain any information, what is the point of them? Why not put them together and work them into an article that says something interesting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 15:\nText: True, and you're right. But it does define it, so doesn't that mean it shouldn't have a comma?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 16:\nText: I had no idea that I was such a rogue admin. Are you seriously suggesting that I need to be kicked off the project for closing a deletion debate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Useful image indeed. Do you happen to have a source to add to the powergrid image, so we can use it in the articles as a verified thing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 19:\nText: I note that you have redirected the latter article (3,500+ characters, edit history back to Nov 2008, half a dozen references) to the former (650 characters, created today - by you, one reference). Is there a discussion/consensus for that move, and are you going to be incorporating much of the redirected articles content into the current one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: I'm sure you're right but I can't find it in FM and haven't found it anywhere else. Could you cite sources in the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: <url>  Honestly, I'd like to know if you really are defending <url>.  Do you really believe that they were justified?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 22:\nText: no problem. ic an hit it up through preferences seciton, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: I'm no expert on the language, but on the face of it that dab page disambiguates two words which are unambiguous anyway - Zakhmet and Khachpas. Am I missing something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 24:\nText: On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you. Would you be willing to do that <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Lionel, tell me the truth.  How long have you known BelloMello was wMo?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: I note that you've edited since this was brought up here. Could you please respond?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: Also - for some reason images on image pages now appear in full size when I view them, rather than more convienient viewing sizes. Do you know how I can fix this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 28:\nText: I suppose I should not have used rollback. I was aware of the problem, but you had not solved it, had you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 29:\nText: When you deleted <url> did you accidentally overlook the <person> template? Or do you have some reason for ignoring it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 30:\nText: As I've only ever tagged one page for speedy deletion before (and that was an obvious cut-and-paste copyvio), I just want to make sure I tagged it properly.  Was db-1 the right tag for <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nText: Im sorry to see that you withdrew. Maybe next time?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
