Be educated and please respond: What does <url> has  to do with <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 4:\nText: Why would you doubt that.

Could I cite the modules for this information?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: So I think it's better research one by one and decide which one is common name (use).

What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: I am stuck with the formatting of <url>, especially the ref tags.

Is <url> adding the correct data, or could it be the same user with a dynamic IP address?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 27:\nText: Please explain why you continue to <url> <url> <url> over the folk magic/Christian revivalist wording in the lede despite the clear consensus against you.

Do you think <url> article is of a quality to maybe nominate it for GA yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: Thanks!
