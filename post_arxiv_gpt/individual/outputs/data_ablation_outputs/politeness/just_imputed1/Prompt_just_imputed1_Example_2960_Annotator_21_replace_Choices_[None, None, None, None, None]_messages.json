Is there anything else I can do to fix the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: At the top of the page it characterizes a guideline as ''a generally accepted standard that editors should follow'' along with a passing reference to <url>. So, I might ask, how would using 4 tildes prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 3:\nText: And now you undid my declination of that one which was copyrighted. Would you ''please'' quit undoing my declinations?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've just noticed I wrote \"It's possibly the most ''possible'' incident in his life\" for \"possibly the most ''important''\", so I may be more caught in the toils of flu than I thought. Check I haven't done anything stupid, and smooth out the text?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: Actually, material in the lead must be discussed in the body. Contemporary economics haven't been discussed in the body, so how can they be discussed in the lead?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: Hmm, well I'll see before judging.

Perhaps next time you would bring your concerns directly to '''me'''?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: A redirect works exactly the same way regardless of whether there's a space between \"#REDIRECT\" and the target article's name or not. Why bother removing spaces from the redirects if it doesn't change the functionality at all?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks. Can you leave a comment at <url>, saying you are the creator?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: See: <url>. If I remember correctly, you said you planned on cleaning up after the bot tagged the images; is that still the case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: Have you and I reached a compositional (English, not content) impass? Perhaps we should hash it out away from the article and install after having reached teh big A (accomodation or agreement)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hello???  Are you just pretending I don't exist?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 13:\nText: Where does it say in the policy that it doesn't apply to good users?  Where in the policy does it say only soft blocks should be performed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: <url> is at it again, adding in the \"in the Premiership\" content you & I successfully merged several weeks ago. Could you perhaps also drop a note on his talk page asking him to stop?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: I've now supplied a free image on <url> (thanks for motivating me to do so!). Could you perhaps consider your reassessment of the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: Good luck with the remaining time for your nomination. BTW: under what section on <url> do you think it should appear?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 17:\nText: Elkman, there are other ways to take a Wikibreak. Can I help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: Hi Hektor.

Is there a way to make it managable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: In what way do the GMTV images, such as <url>, conform with the guidelines at <url>? Where is the statement on the website saying that it is a press kit, and the images can be reproduced?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 23:\nText: Who???\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 24:\nText: I saw your notes, and will watch for any objections.  If there are none, in two days, do you mind if I move that page and start the new categorization page/discussion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: Eight more articles semi-protected. How many of these damned T & J articles are there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 26:\nText: Thank you, it's much appreciated. What do you think of the changes so far?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 27:\nText: Do you think <url> warrants instant removal? I'd rather not leave the article there until after the election, in the interests of fairness to other non-noteable candidates do you think instant removal is warranted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 28:\nText: While the Curriculum and Campus sections could use some references, i think this is ready to go live. Do you know how to move this to the main article space?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 29:\nText: No, Wikipedia does not consider itself (or wikis in general) as a reliable source.
