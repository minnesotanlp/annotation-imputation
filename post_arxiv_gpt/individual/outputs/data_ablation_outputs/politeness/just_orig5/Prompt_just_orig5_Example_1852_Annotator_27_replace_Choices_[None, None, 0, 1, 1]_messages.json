Your output should be an integer label:\nTarget Example:\nText: Hello -- I see you changed a couple of entries relating to \"PALATINE, the Subject Centre for Dance, Drama and Music of the UK Higher Education Academy\".  I don't know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer and nothing else."
