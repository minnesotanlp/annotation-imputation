In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: Where is the exception in <url> for "tossing out citations and verifiable in order to make it easier for the reader"?  Who are you to disagree with Nikon's label of "Compact Professional"?
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer corresponding to the label.
