In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: Is <url> what you're referring to??  '''''One''''' autograph page that he deleted almost '''''five months''''' ago and you're now attacking him as if he deleted every single autograph book ever?
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer and nothing else.
