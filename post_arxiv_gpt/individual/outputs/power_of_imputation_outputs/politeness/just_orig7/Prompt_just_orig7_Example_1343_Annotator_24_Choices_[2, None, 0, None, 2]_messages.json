What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 3:\nText: I have a quick question for you (I'm asking now since I am sure that this is going to be brought up either at the ACR or the FAC, when I finally get there): you've added a \"pp.\" for the citation given for the national defense authorization act of 2007, but the rest of the article makes use of the \"p.\" system. Shouldn't the \"pp.\" be changed to a \"p.\" for conformity, or is the use of the \"pp.\" correct from the perspective of citation guidelines?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 4:\nText: All my edits to clear Lloyd George disappeared from the running count. They haven't been undone, is this a bug?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 5:\nText: 4. I had once felt that the Euroleague, Italian and Greek leagues were the top leagues. If I were to choose selected European leagues from this page <url>, do you have any thoughts on which ones are important?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: I noticed that you twice placed a request for citation on the <url> page,<url> <url>, but it was silently removed by <url> <url>. I've removed the sentence altogether; do you think any other action should be taken at this point?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hello -- I see you changed a couple of entries relating to \"PALATINE, the Subject Centre for Dance, Drama and Music of the UK Higher Education Academy\".  I don't know (or even care) why that organisation chooses to refer to itself by capitalising the word, but (and I ask for information here) is there a policy that precludes us from respecting that choice?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hi, you've done a lot of work on comparing FA country articles. Are you aware of any country that got special praise for the selection of images in the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: I think this is a clear case of <url> . What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: I think I'm gonna request a free image from a Wikipedia biography subject by following <url>. I was wondering, if I'm planning to upload the image to Commons and the subject doesn't speak English to understand the e-mail, what should I do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 11:\nText: What?!  Why did you resolve this without dealing with the User I mentioned?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hi, noticed you removed categories on defunct/renamed schools. Why do you think them unnecessary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nTarget Example:\nText: See email first. Is this coming from somewhere or something particular?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nThe only valid output is a single integer."
