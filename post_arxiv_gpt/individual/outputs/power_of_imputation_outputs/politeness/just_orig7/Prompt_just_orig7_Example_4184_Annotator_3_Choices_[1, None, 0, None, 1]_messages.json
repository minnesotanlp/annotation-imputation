This file seems to have existed for two years without deletion, so perhaps you could explain the grounds for speedy deletion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 2:\nText: Why do you contend that New Atheism and Atheism 3.0 are unrelated? They are so intermingled that people have difficulty discerning which is which?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: (undent) Your Chinese is much better than mine. Is it possible in Chinese to omit a conjunction such as u548c or u8ddf and let a string of two successive nouns refer to a set of two objects?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 4:\nText: Since your tube station articles don't actually contain any information, what is the point of them? Why not put them together and work them into an article that says something interesting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 2\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi Acad - the above has led me to two native Danish speakers on the English wiki - <url> and Saddhiyama--<url> - the first is \" very active on naval articles.\" and has just translated HMS Falcon (1802) for Danish Wiki<url>.  Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: You were asking for a source for the <url> mention of the <url> service to Lagos from March 29th, which you reverted.  Would <url> do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hi Steve, I've added refs & cites to this article. Do you think it still needs a warning about lack of refs/citations?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I very much disagree that the article that was deleted was advertising; I have never bought anything from his store as a matter of fact, but I do know that his is one of the most used online Judaica shops out there. What can I do to make the article acceptable?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer and nothing else."
