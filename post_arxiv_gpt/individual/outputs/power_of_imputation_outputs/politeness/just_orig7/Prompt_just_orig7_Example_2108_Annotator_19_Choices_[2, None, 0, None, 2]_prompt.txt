Example 7:
Text: I tried to make sense of the CfD rules and procedures as I think this: <url> has no reason to exist, but I decided instead to just bug the first person on the CfD discussions who seemed to know what they are doing, so I come to you.  Could you properly nominate this for deletion?

Text: I started editing the article <url>, which was a real mess, and added some cited content under the math section.

Annotation from annotator: 19

Target Example:
Text: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?
