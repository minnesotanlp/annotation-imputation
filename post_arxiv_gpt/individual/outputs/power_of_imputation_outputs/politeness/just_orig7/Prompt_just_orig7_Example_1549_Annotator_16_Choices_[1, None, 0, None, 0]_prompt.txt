Human-rated Examples:
Example 1:

Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 2:
Text: Your "resolution" was to move it back to "Detective Terry Crowley" again? Why do you keep doing that?
Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 3:
Text: My question about the truncation operation is to understand the generic algorithm for applying a ring (or un-ringing) a Dynkin node. What method (code) do you use to get the higher dimensions truncated based on the Coxeter Dynkin ringed nodes?

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 10:
Text: According to <url>, links are permissible as part of your signature but be sure to check the "'''Sign my name exactly as shown'''" box.  What happens when you load '''<nowiki><url><url> (<url>)</nowiki>''' into the signature window and check the box?
Annotation from annotator: 16
