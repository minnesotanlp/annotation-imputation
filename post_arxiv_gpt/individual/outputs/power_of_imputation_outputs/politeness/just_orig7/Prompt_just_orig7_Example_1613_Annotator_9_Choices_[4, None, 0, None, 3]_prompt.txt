Annotation from annotator: 4

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 3:
Text: Hello. Was wondering where you got his Birmingham squad number from?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 4:
Text: Hm, I was unaware of said threads. Would you mind providing me with a link?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 5:
Text: Thanks for the various corrections you have made to this article. Do you have a source for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date of 921, please?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 6:
Text: The Italian and English rules are different from the Spanish. But if you think about it, would it make sense to list every reserve player who makes a first team appearance?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 7:
Text: Make that "copyvio tag". OK if I revert under those conditions?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 8:
Text: Already past my two "spelling correction" edits ;) (though they are obsessed with defense). I noticed one of them changed a quoted spelling: ''acknowledgment'' to ''acknowledgement'', did you get that one?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 9:
Text: <url> - You made a bold edit, I reverted and now we discuss. Is there a reason why the Wikipedia editor generated filmography should be deleted and replaced by a link to an outside site?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 10:
Text: I'm doing the same.  Hey, can you please tell me if <url> has been fixed enough by being stub-ified?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 11:
Text: Sorry, I will check into this next week. Have you preserved UTF-8 (see comments on top of the wikEd code)?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Target Example:
Text: Delete, who cares. If we're going to delete every fair use image that ''has'' a sufficient rationale, why not change to German Wikipedia image policy already?
