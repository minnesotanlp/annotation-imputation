Is this convenient for you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: The thread at <url> ground to a halt. Any way to get this implemented?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: Who deleted it? Would I be violating due process if I undeleted it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 4:\nText: I disagree with your edit of the 21st of November.  Would you object to me inserting a new version based around the word 'Notwithstanding'?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: I think you made a mistake in merging <url> onto <url> instead of <url>.  Or did you want to do further editing before actually adding the material into <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 6:\nText: I.m keen to see your recent abbey article on the main page, but there are no references. Can this be fixed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 7:\nText: BTW, as a complete aside, I have wondered for years why Enver Bey/Pasha is at <url>. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: an IP user changed Liam's Name into Reim in <url> and i havent seen anyone undo his edit. IS it the official English name?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: I've been going through <url> and replacing the FiveHorizons.com refs (per Quadzilla99's comments). However, refs 39 and 40 don't seem to appear anywhere else; could you perhaps replace them with more reliable sources if you get the chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: Hi there, what do you think would be a good way to explicitly point out in IPA that a two vowel string is <url> and not a <url>? Can one use the same underdot diacritic used for <url>s, <person>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: Where are the actual findings of fact and sanctions in Haiduc's case? Do they need to be tweaked?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I plan on getting the page up at some point this weekend, no latter than Monday though for obvious reasons. Why do you ask?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nIf you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset."
