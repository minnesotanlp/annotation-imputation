In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Human-rated Examples:
Example 1:
Text: I also have problems with a lot of the other recategorisation you have done to these articles, but I won't revert any more until I hear from you.  Taking <url> as an example: why have you removed it from <url> when it clearly is a linear filter; why remove it from <url> when it forms part of image parameter theory; why does an article which discusses electronic designs not belong in <url>; why remove it from <url> when, obviously, it is a term?
Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 2:
Text: I'd be more than happy to :) It may take a while as I've got other stuff on, but as long as you're in no immediate hurry all should be well. Do you have any preferences/requirements for the end result?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 3:
Text: Still at 1024 x 768 here '''Zangar''' and still looks fine to me. What about putting one of the images into the infobox using the piped 'static image=' parameter?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 4:
Text: No, Wikipedia does not consider itself (or wikis in general) as a reliable source. Surely you know such a basic policy?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 5:
Text: Nice work!  Since you dug up some information on Fahnbulleh, I'm curious u2014 do you know what relation he is to Ambassador Henry Fahnbulleh, whom Tubman accused of an attempted coup?
Annotation from annotator: 24

Example 6:
Text: I want to purchase a macro lens and was hoping for some guidance from you. Apart from being good in macro, can it be used to take good pictures of landscape and portraits?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 7:
Text: Very well I won't contact you anymore. Geez, whatever happen to the spirit of collaboration?
Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 8:
Text: When you said "we're RBIing" I assumed you were associating your edits with those of TenOfAllTrades. Were you associating your edits with those of someone else, or do you use the plural pronoun?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 9:
Text: Just to let you know, you appear to have conducted the same blanking of links four times within a 24-hour period, in three different instances. Shall I report you for this, or will you kindly restore the links?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 10:
Text: Hi there. I can't remember how long you said it would take to come up with the list you were thinking of doing, but I thought I'd ask you if anything came of this or not?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 11:
Text: I'd like to ask why you're so insistent on creating a page called <url>, which means the same thing as <url>.  Are you disagreeing that they mean the same thing, do you feel that the <url> article is bad, or do you feel that <url> is a better name for the article?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 12:
Text: Interesting.  Would you mind asking at which Sae Gae seminar on what date it was taken?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Target Example:
Text: And wasting our time as well. I can only repeat: why don't you do constructive work by adding contents about your beloved Makedonia?
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer and nothing else.
