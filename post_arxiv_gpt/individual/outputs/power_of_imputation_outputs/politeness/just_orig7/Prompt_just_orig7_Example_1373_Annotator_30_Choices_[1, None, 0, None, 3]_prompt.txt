Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 2:
Text: My problem is that the Style Guide for cities causes several topics for this small village to be repeated somewhat, especially the railroad, Gas Boom, and stockyard.  Any thoughts on this article's organization?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 3:

Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 4:
Text: I clean up the <url> article a bit. What do you think?

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 6:
Text: Your POV tag justified. Did you get any support for cleaning it up?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 7:
Text: My rationale for nominating <url> for CSD as promotional was that the show has not yet aired, so an episode summary at this point sounds like a promotional leak. Was I being overzealous?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 8:
Text: Greetings, sorry to bother you here... I have been using the MissingTopics tool for years, to generate <url> The last time I used it successfully was Nov 16.  Something must have changed in the algorhythms since then, because it will no longer read any page starting with an Amharic character... Is it broke?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 12:

Annotation from annotator: 20

Target Example:
Text: Hello, I am interested in helping out with <url> and <url>, but the pages are very very long, which is unmanageable and discouraging. Could you please break them up into (many) smaller subpages?
