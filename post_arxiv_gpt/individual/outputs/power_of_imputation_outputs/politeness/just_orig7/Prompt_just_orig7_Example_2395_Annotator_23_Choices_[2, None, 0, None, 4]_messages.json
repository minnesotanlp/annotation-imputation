What is that template?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 11:\nText: What do you suggest we do? Since it looks like Gaddafi may retake Ras Lanuf in a day or so and there has been fighting there for the last four days, should we create an article named Second battle of Ras Lanuf or should we reopen the old one and say when the rebels took it it was phase one and now, two days later, it's phase two?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 12:\nText: Could you please explain <url> to me?
