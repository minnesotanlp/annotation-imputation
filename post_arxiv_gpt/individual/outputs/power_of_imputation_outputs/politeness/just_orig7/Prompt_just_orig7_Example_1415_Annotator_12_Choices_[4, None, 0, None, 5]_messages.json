You seem to know a lot about them, could you please help out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: I seeu2014yes, those can easily be changed back. Would you rather I start a fresh discussion about these?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: Please explain how that is a personal attack? You do realise that someone critisizing your actions is not the same as a personal attack don't you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 4:\nText: Why nominate this for deletion? It was obviously created by someone who didn't know how to use redirects, so would it not be best to just correct it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: I kind of agree.  Are you planning on actually editing Wikipedia, or is your whole purpose here to promote this ... study (or whatever it is)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 6:\nText: Are you saying that Scotty was being \"hot-headed\"?  If so, can you please tell us what Scotty did that was \"hot-headed\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 7:\nText: Stephen's solution certainly isn't optimal. Fancy giving me a basic rundown on the problem here and I'll see if I can devise a more elegant one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 8:\nText: Oh, I see that you removed the redirect from District of Columbia and restored the text.  That has redirected to \"Washington DC\" for about 4 years now, and I've reverted it - if you have something ambitious in mind, please bring it up on one of the talk pages first, okay?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks, can we write an article on that ? do you think it is notable enough ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used \"on\".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Then maybe admins should focus on copyright infringements and avoid the leader/educator/cop/parliamentarian roles that they cherish so much.  Could 1000 admins handle this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 12:\nText: Thanks.  Is Brazil4Linux doing anything particully bad right now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I removed that second paragraph entirely, since the information is covered in the article.  Do you feel that the lead should be larger?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nIf you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset. So, please only output a single integer."
