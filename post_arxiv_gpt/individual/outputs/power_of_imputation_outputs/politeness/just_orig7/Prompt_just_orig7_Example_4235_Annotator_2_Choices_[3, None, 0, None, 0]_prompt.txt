In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Human-rated Examples: (there may not be any)
Example 1:
Text: I notice that to the <url> and <url> pages edited '''''Gorka''''' '''Josxe9 Unda Velasco''' and changed it to simply ''Gorka''. Why?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 2:
Text: That's basically what our members have said, not necessarily my opinion. Anything I miss?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 3:
Text: The <url> page said that <url> will be shown on the <url> subchannels 26.5 and 26.6, and also on analog channel 48. It is also expected that The U Too will displace Me Too from analog channel 48. If that's the case, then, where do you suppose Me Too will end up? What new channel in Chicago will it be shown on?
Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 4:
Text: You make it very hard to believe that you're acting in good faith when you rewrite the <url> article to remove all references to "liberal," but keep the phrase "conservative Independence Institute."  I see POV-pushing when that happens.  If you're so concerned about adjectives, why not edit the articles about AEI or Heritage or Americans for Tax Reform?
Annotation from annotator: 2

Example 5:
Text: I pretty much agree with <url>, except I would like to know why you modified the see also section to be a hatnote. Doesn't <url> have specific requirements for this?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 6:
Text: Certainly the work is out of copyright, and some of the neighboring volumes in the series are visible on archive.org (and I don't have trouble with other books on google generally).  I wonder if you know of any way, or could suggest any way, that I could get to see the downloaded pdf of Newcomb vol.6?
Annotation from annotator: 22

Target Example:
Text: You said you were promoting them, but, um... they aren't listed at <url>, they still say they're FPOCs on their talk pages, etc, etc. Should we consider them featured or not?
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer corresponding to the label.
