I want to reconcile what you know with what I know so we can get this article right... a little help here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 2:\nText: Acad, at <url> the article suddenly starts talking about ''Pomone'' without any context - is this a typo?

If you can't then what do I need to do to get blocked indefinitely?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: This is irritating.

Do you know or do you know anyone that knows anything about the <url> or the <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nExample 8:\nText: Thank you for your kind comment.

What is your response to my suggestion <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 10:\nText: Thanks for reverting <url> - that was actually me, unlogged in.
