What do I put for the author, description, and stuff?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hello. Was wondering where you got his Birmingham squad number from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hm, I was unaware of said threads. Would you mind providing me with a link?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: Thanks for the various corrections you have made to this article. Do you have a source for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date of 921, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: The Italian and English rules are different from the Spanish. But if you think about it, would it make sense to list every reserve player who makes a first team appearance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: Make that \"copyvio tag\". OK if I revert under those conditions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: Already past my two \"spelling correction\" edits ;) (though they are obsessed with defense).

Is there a reason why the Wikipedia editor generated filmography should be deleted and replaced by a link to an outside site?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: I'm doing the same.  Hey, can you please tell me if <url> has been fixed enough by being stub-ified?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: Sorry, I will check into this next week. Have you preserved UTF-8 (see comments on top of the wikEd code)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Delete, who cares. If we're going to delete every fair use image that ''has'' a sufficient rationale, why not change to German Wikipedia image policy already?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer corresponding to the label."
