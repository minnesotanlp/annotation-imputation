What are your thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 3:\nText: Granted, it wouldn't be terribly difficult for me to recreate what I did, but I don't like doing extra work when I don't have to. Could you at least userfy the last version edited by me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 4:\nText: OK then.

Is there a reason for your sorrow my good man?\nAnnotation from annotator: 24\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I thought that VAMOS section was dealing primarily with captions (perhaps a clearer wording is needed there?). Also, I have seen dates used as adjectives quite often - the \"1848 Revolution\", for example - where did you read about this rule?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nIf you output anything other than a single integer, your output will be considered invalid.If you output anything other than a single integer, your output will harm the integrity of our dataset."
