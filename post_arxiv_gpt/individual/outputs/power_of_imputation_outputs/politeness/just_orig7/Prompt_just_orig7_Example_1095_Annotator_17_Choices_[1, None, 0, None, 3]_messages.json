But: \"We have three volunteers: Awadewit, Mike Christie and Wrad.\" Given that I, you know, proposed the countries idea, wasn't it obvious that I was volunteering?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 2:\nText: Upon further thought, maybe I could look through lists of deleted articles to see if any interest me and see if I can bring them back (with adequate sourcing). Do you know anything about that process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 3:\nText: I don't think we know each other. Is there any matter you need help with?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 4:\nText: \"Redirecting is blanking\" would be more accurate. Or maybe \"redirecting is redirecting\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: <url> has been promoted to A-class. Shouldn't that score?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 6:\nText: Many thanks. I'm afraid I don't know the reel - is it played in your part or the world?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 7:\nText: They all used to be dabs that linked to other dabs which are now housed in the pages I moved them to, so I don't think there's too a need to restore them. Also, I eliminated the \"4th of July (song)\" redirect as there was only one page linking to it; no use for a redirect if nobody is going to it, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: I know you moved the section about the  theme park because someone complained it did not belong in 'fandom', but i'm not convinced that was correct. exactly what sort of people go to such a place if not fans?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 9:\nText: I've started looking at this article as you asked and inevitably I've got a few questions. Would you prefer me to list them here or on the article's talk page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 10:\nText: It looks like those news sources are all poker blogs.   Are there any that meet <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 11:\nText: I have it now; it lists 22 Members, seven officers and a large number of sons of Members. Do you think we could run to a new article, say <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 12:\nText: Not really sure what the remedy is for this, but anyway, now you know. How was your weekend?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Quite welcome. Doesn't Huggle use rollback when available and applicable (last several edits were by the same user)?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nIf you output anything other than a single integer, your output will be considered invalid.If you output anything other than a single integer, your output will harm the integrity of our dataset."
