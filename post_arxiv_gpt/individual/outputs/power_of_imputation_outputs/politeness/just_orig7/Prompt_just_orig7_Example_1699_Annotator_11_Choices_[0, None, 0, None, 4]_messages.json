But could it also cover wikiversity and perhaps the other sister projects?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 3:\nText: Well...  pretty much most of what was in the old table, and the category links.

Is that what you wanted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: That sounds fine.
