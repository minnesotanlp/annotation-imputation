Don't you think a little discussion is in order before doing this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: Ron - I'm interested in your edit comment here <url>. Your position is that RC is a sufficiently reliable source that anything it mentions is automatically notable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 3:\nText: I think it is important to note that Spirit 03 was the last gunship to be brought down and that it has not been involved in a Class A mishap since that date. Should we include that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: Should I move it myself, or would you like me to walk you thru it? Have you read <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 5:\nText: I thought we had already established consensus last month. What exactly is the deal with the parenthesis and columns?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 6:\nText: I believe you wanted to find out which party the PP was? Well i'm sure you'll be able to find it at http://elections.uwa.edu.au/partysearch.lasso - my guess is that it could be the Progress Party, who ran in the 1977 WA HoR election?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: How do I \"inform a Wikiproject\"? I would have liked to do so in several articles, but is this not <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: Page has been locked - as the only real place to report issues the government experiences is on the Prime Minister of the time's page, I find it quite simply a 'whitewash' to have the AWB/cole enquiry section on his page, there since it happened, removed a few months before the election. Your views?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 9:\nText: Sure, but what's the deal with fair use and cropping?  I thought the Zatanna one got removed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Somewhere I've got a Twins program from a few years ago that had a cover-story interview with Harmon Killebrew. Would that be a valid source, or would a game program's here-today-gone-tomorrow nature raise questions about it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nTarget Example:\nText: You use the abbreviation WPMOS on your request on the Graphic Map Lab <url>. What does it mean?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nIf you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset."
