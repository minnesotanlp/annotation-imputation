Example 2:
Text: Funny, you could not tell it was me... who else would it be??
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 3:
Text: Hello Sirmyles, I noticed a puzzling section on <url> that could only have been written by you (about the parallels with Shiite law). I would appreciate if you could identify a source that could possibly support this assertion?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 4:
Text: Remember we had the whole edit warring on Edelsten article a while back? I find it curious that a recently created account posted this <url> as their first contribution basically supporting Edelsten's personal website (which when you look would hardly pass <url>, I looked it at this site a while back in research and found some of the positive claims could not be verified) and wanting a complete rewrite of the article... sound familiar?

Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 10:
Text: Listen, the reason I put those signs in the code 'break-clear' is because the arrangement of the blocks is ''off-key'', at least when looking through IE or Mozilla. Why are you taking them off?
