Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 2:
Text: Ron - I'm interested in your edit comment here <url>. Your position is that RC is a sufficiently reliable source that anything it mentions is automatically notable?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 3:
Text: I think it is important to note that Spirit 03 was the last gunship to be brought down and that it has not been involved in a Class A mishap since that date. Should we include that?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 4:
Text: Should I move it myself, or would you like me to walk you thru it? Have you read <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: I thought we had already established consensus last month. What exactly is the deal with the parenthesis and columns?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 6:
Text: I believe you wanted to find out which party the PP was? Well i'm sure you'll be able to find it at http://elections.uwa.edu.au/partysearch.lasso - my guess is that it could be the Progress Party, who ran in the 1977 WA HoR election?

Example 7:
Text: How do I "inform a Wikiproject"? I would have liked to do so in several articles, but is this not <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 8:
Text: Page has been locked - as the only real place to report issues the government experiences is on the Prime Minister of the time's page, I find it quite simply a 'whitewash' to have the AWB/cole enquiry section on his page, there since it happened, removed a few months before the election. Your views?

Example 9:
Text: Sure, but what's the deal with fair use and cropping?  I thought the Zatanna one got removed?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 10:
Text: Somewhere I've got a Twins program from a few years ago that had a cover-story interview with Harmon Killebrew. Would that be a valid source, or would a game program's here-today-gone-tomorrow nature raise questions about it?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Target Example:
Text: You use the abbreviation WPMOS on your request on the Graphic Map Lab <url>. What does it mean?
