Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 3:
Text: Please explain how that is a personal attack? You do realise that someone critisizing your actions is not the same as a personal attack don't you?
Annotation from annotator: 3

Example 4:
Text: Why nominate this for deletion? It was obviously created by someone who didn't know how to use redirects, so would it not be best to just correct it?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 5:

Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 6:

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 8:
Text: Oh, I see that you removed the redirect from District of Columbia and restored the text.  That has redirected to "Washington DC" for about 4 years now, and I've reverted it - if you have something ambitious in mind, please bring it up on one of the talk pages first, okay?

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 11:
Text: Then maybe admins should focus on copyright infringements and avoid the leader/educator/cop/parliamentarian roles that they cherish so much.  Could 1000 admins handle this?

Annotation from annotator: 13
