Example 2:
Text: Hi there, I've raised the possibility of unprotecting the tamazepam page <url>. What are your thoughts?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 3:
Text: Granted, it wouldn't be terribly difficult for me to recreate what I did, but I don't like doing extra work when I don't have to. Could you at least userfy the last version edited by me?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 4:
Text: OK then. What's your problem with putting this in the lead : "is one of the <url> counties of the <url> and " ?
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 5:

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 6:
Text: I was in doubt too, but when dealing with such incomprehensible concoctions I prefer to err on the side of BLP caution.  Would you like it userfied?

Example 10:
Text: Probably. Could you deal with this one?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 11:
Text: Very well.  However, since the cartoon and Fleewtay version ''don't'' have an article, perhaps they should be mentioned on this page or given articles of their own?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 12:
Text: '''Wiki-star''': Hm? Is there a reason for your sorrow my good man?
Annotation from annotator: 24

Target Example:
Text: I thought that VAMOS section was dealing primarily with captions (perhaps a clearer wording is needed there?). Also, I have seen dates used as adjectives quite often - the "1848 Revolution", for example - where did you read about this rule?
