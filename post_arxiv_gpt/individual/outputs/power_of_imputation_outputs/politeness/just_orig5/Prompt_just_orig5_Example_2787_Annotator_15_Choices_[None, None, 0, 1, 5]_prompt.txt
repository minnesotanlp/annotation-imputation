In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: I thought that VAMOS section was dealing primarily with captions (perhaps a clearer wording is needed there?). Also, I have seen dates used as adjectives quite often - the "1848 Revolution", for example - where did you read about this rule?
Annotation from annotator:
If you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset. So, please only output a single integer.
