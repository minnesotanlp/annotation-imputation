In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: I very much disagree that the article that was deleted was advertising; I have never bought anything from his store as a matter of fact, but I do know that his is one of the most used online Judaica shops out there. What can I do to make the article acceptable?
Annotation from annotator:
If you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset. So, please only output a single integer.
