Annotation from annotator: 21

Example 10:
Text: OK, then, define "bias", propose a way to quantify it, and if it's accepted by consensus, we'll apply it to ''all'' the admins on that page. Or, perhaps as a starting point, how about presenting some evidence?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 11:
Text: I had some problems updating images in the <url> FAC. The images are uploaded both on Wikipedia and on Wikimedia Commons under the same name ... how do I get the links on the page to connect to the Wikimedia images rather than the Wikipedia ones?
Annotation from annotator: 15

Annotation from annotator: 22

Example 15:
Text: Thanks. Now, if I had to make an infobox on "London" (just ''London'', I know there are many terms: Greater London, City of London etc), would it be correct to include the area/population/density of the territories I mentioned + the city area, or would just the city area suffice?

Annotation from annotator: 9

Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 22:
Text: Unfortunately, I'm still worried this may not be enough to avoid arguments.  <url> says "A separate rationale must be provided each time the image is used in an article."  Should we just copy the tag for every article using the logo?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 23:
Text: Wikipedia is not IMDb, which can easily be used (and is more suited) to providing complete soundtrack listings for pretty much every movie ever made. Would you care to address any of the other points I've brought up?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 24:

Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 28:
Text: I am not sure what are rules about GA in en.wiki but for me <url> is really outdated and it shouldn`t have GA sign. What you think?

Text: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 30:
Text: Converting <url> to a redirect without preserving either the information or sources, & without discussion was ill-advised. A bit more care in future?

Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 2:
Text: In the piece <url> it there's mention of being listed as national historic site, but doesn'' appear to be listed on Hudson or Essex. Any ideas?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 3:
Text: Hi J.  I'm thinking it might be a bad idea to start linking all unnamed EP recordings to the EP dab page.  Could turn into a very massive list, and maybe not the right use for a dab page?

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 7:
Text: I tried to make sense of the CfD rules and procedures as I think this: <url> has no reason to exist, but I decided instead to just bug the first person on the CfD discussions who seemed to know what they are doing, so I come to you.  Could you properly nominate this for deletion?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 8:
Text: Hello-I think you know more about <url> than I do. Want to check it?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 9:
Text: Hey, I just went ahead and reverted <url>. I was wondering if you wanted your userpage semi-protected to prevent that happening in the future?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 10:
Text: I put plural women because in the storylines it states he falls for Detective Graves. He also hits on another older woman <url> but that wasn't notable enough to include.. is it best to keep it singular?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 12:
Text: I was wondering why you removed him from Category:Alameda. He's pretty famous around there and it would be notable to have him in the category of Alameda, wouldn't it?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Target Example:
Text: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?
