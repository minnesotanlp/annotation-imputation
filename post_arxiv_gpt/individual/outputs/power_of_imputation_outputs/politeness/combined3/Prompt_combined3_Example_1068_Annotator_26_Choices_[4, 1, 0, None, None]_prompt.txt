Imputed Examples:
Example 1:
Text: I noticed you added the Jean Chretien link to the homepage, which is nice, but you didn't put any comment for the changelog and you also didn't bump of the last article, you bumped off the 2nd last article.  Why?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 2:
Text: Hello, I've written a page about the <url>, shamelessly copying the style from your CCT/FoFC lists. In the process, have I missed anything out?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 3:

Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 4:
Text: Actually it was a compliment. Does that count as an 'issue'?
Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 5:
Text: Could you please explain <url> to me? I don't see how deleting a person's userpage is correct?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 6:
Text: And  what did I do wrong???????????????????????
Annotation from annotator: 4

Example 7:
Text: The policy is tricky - I guess it comes down to whether or not you think the account is going to be disruptive, and whether it is appropriate to guess that ahead of time.  On the other hand, looks like another overreaction to Kurt, in my opinion - what do you think?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 8:
Text: Hmm...I was not aware that a year had to pass for ''anyone'' to request an appeal for Everyking. Prior to today, when did they ever say this?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 10:
Text: You deleted this, but somehow it still shows up on the parent category's page <url>.  Is this normal and/or can you fix this?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 11:
Text: Technically, Taku is within his rights to change things to conform to an existing standard, but it's not very politic of him to do so; if we decide to change, then it's still more meaningless work to change everything once again. Unfortunately, it's all too common for editors to edit first and talk second, eh?
Annotation from annotator: 7

Example 12:
Text: Hello Jeffq, I noticed you revert vandalism occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account <url> to help you revert vandalism more easily?

Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 14:

Annotation from annotator: 10

Text: It turns out that the Zelda Collection you referred to in <url> didn't include aLttP, reportedly because the GBA remake was still being sold at that time, so that disc included NES and N64 emulation but left out SNES. Do you have another example?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Text: Do your sources have the dates of birth and death for <url>, which I just created? And, while I'm on the topic, any information regarding his playing career (if applicable)?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 22:
Text: Unfortunately, I'm still worried this may not be enough to avoid arguments.  <url> says "A separate rationale must be provided each time the image is used in an article."  Should we just copy the tag for every article using the logo?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 28:
Text: I am not sure what are rules about GA in en.wiki but for me <url> is really outdated and it shouldn`t have GA sign. What you think?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 29:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 5:
Text: Lemme just remember, who's going to be mentioned first? Snyder, or the failed projects?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 6:
Text: In fact, what I'd like to propose here is that we take a bit more control, establish some stricter edit warring restrictions, unprotect the page, slap up an edit notice, and enforce them with blocks so that people can get back to writing the article. Do you think that would have a positive effect?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 7:
Text: Incidentally, your username seems familiar. Do you contribute to SPGB-related forums by any chance?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 8:
Text: I apologise, I didn't actually see the message on my talk page, I assumed you meant the article talk page. If you are concerned that the "free" image has been uploaded under a false license, then perhaps you could nominate it for deletion?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 9:
Text: Yes, I know what a score ''card'' is, but you wrote "score '''car'''" in the article. Was that a typo, or is there really such a thing as a score "car"?
Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 10:
Text: Oops.  Hmm...yeah...that sounds like a good idea...why not go ahead?
Annotation from annotator: 11

Example 11:
Text: Maybe you can clarify what you meant by "legal action" then? Perhaps you just meant as opposed to illegal actions?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 12:
Text: I think that if you use an example paragraph, and show the options in a nowiki tag, it will make it easier for people to "vote" for the method they like. Make sense?
