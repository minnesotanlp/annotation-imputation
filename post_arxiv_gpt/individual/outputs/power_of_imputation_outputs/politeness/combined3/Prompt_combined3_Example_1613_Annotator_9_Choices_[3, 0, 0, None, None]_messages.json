What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 2:\nText: Hi Tim, I received the photograph from Delft but it's page looks a mess and I can't edit it. Can you, or do you know someone who can, fix it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: Alistair, you have only undone the autoblock; you haven't unblocked the account yet. Could you do that, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hey, when do we add games for the EHF Champion League and the Basketball EuroLeague into the portal? And NFL every week?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 5:\nText: I saw that page but was not sure if it had anything to do with any of the articles we are working on? or was this a general issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: I was wondering where you got your information for the dice statistics you recently added/changed in <url>.  Can you add a source to those tables?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 7:\nText: You're welcome to revert edits, but I'm puzzled as to why you reverted this one - it seems absolutely essential to me the give a summary of Genesis 1. And if you revert Gen1, why leave Gen2?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hmm...I was not aware that a year had to pass for ''anyone'' to request an appeal for Everyking. Prior to today, when did they ever say this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 9:\nText: I understand your point about MJ being very close and having competent editors, but do you not think those of us who understand the source problems, etc. that the Reagan page is having should try and explain them to those editors (that is, try to educate them)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: Sorry, I dont quite remember what we were talking about.  Can you tell me what you were/are confused about?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 11:\nText: Alternatively, maybe the second column could be '''Country of origin''' and Rosen could simply be denoted USA/Poland, while Pillsbury would be USA/USA, without his US State being mentioned - it would be less confusing I think. Any thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 12:\nText: I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 13:\nText: that hotcat lockup, was like an edit conflict, so i tried a backup and re-enter.  thanks for the assistance, i'm using the old layout, so would the new view affect my hotcat category edits?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 14:\nText: ...and, really, BeeGees?  And not Peter Frampton?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thanks. Now, if I had to make an infobox on \"London\" (just ''London'', I know there are many terms: Greater London, City of London etc), would it be correct to include the area/population/density of the territories I mentioned + the city area, or would just the city area suffice?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 16:\nText: The file above does not meet the <url> so as to be copyrighted or eligible for fair use, as I had stated so on <url> when I first moved it there. What issues should be resolved?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 17:\nText: It turns out that the Zelda Collection you referred to in <url> didn't include aLttP, reportedly because the GBA remake was still being sold at that time, so that disc included NES and N64 emulation but left out SNES. Do you have another example?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: It does not appear to have attracted any participants other than Gerda. Perhaps adding a <person> template would draw in more participants?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 19:\nText: The <url> has a request (header \"<url>\") left a few hours ago by someone who has pictures of signs in China but can't read them.  Would you please be willing to help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 20:\nText: That was a nice pic you put up in the Civil War article. where did you find it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 21:\nText: I took a quick look and I'm not up to reading through it properly at the moment. :) I'll be back on here tomorrow morning and I'll have a look then, if that's OK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: Unfortunately, I'm still worried this may not be enough to avoid arguments.  <url> says \"A separate rationale must be provided each time the image is used in an article.\"  Should we just copy the tag for every article using the logo?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: Hello. Since you have contributed to <url> in the past, could you spare a minute to discuss the fate of <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 24:\nText: Also, all in all, I think Batman should be changed to <url>, not <url>, as the latter refers to those with superhuman powers or abilities, which he lacks. Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 25:\nText: Ok, I'd agree about <url> being better. Should I delete the other one (you could also tag it for speedy deletion as a mistake)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: Thanks for your reply. I've tried to incorporate the references into the article; how is it now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 27:\nText: I've never seen something go beyond AN/I myself, and I find it hard to believe the other two hadn't been tried by now. Or is it a case-by-case thing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 28:\nText: I am not sure what are rules about GA in en.wiki but for me <url> is really outdated and it shouldn`t have GA sign. What you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 29:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 30:\nText: Done. I may have missed a few links when copying them across, so could you please look through it just in case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nHuman-rated Examples: (there may not be any)\nExample 1:\nText: If you completely disagree then why havn't you required references on other airport pages??\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 2:\nText: I'm the uploader of the hubble pictures.  What do I put for the author, description, and stuff?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hello. Was wondering where you got his Birmingham squad number from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hm, I was unaware of said threads. Would you mind providing me with a link?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: Thanks for the various corrections you have made to this article. Do you have a source for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date of 921, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: The Italian and English rules are different from the Spanish. But if you think about it, would it make sense to list every reserve player who makes a first team appearance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: Make that \"copyvio tag\". OK if I revert under those conditions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: Already past my two \"spelling correction\" edits ;) (though they are obsessed with defense). I noticed one of them changed a quoted spelling: ''acknowledgment'' to ''acknowledgement'', did you get that one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: <url> - You made a bold edit, I reverted and now we discuss. Is there a reason why the Wikipedia editor generated filmography should be deleted and replaced by a link to an outside site?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: I'm doing the same.  Hey, can you please tell me if <url> has been fixed enough by being stub-ified?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: Sorry, I will check into this next week. Have you preserved UTF-8 (see comments on top of the wikEd code)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Delete, who cares. If we're going to delete every fair use image that ''has'' a sufficient rationale, why not change to German Wikipedia image policy already?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
