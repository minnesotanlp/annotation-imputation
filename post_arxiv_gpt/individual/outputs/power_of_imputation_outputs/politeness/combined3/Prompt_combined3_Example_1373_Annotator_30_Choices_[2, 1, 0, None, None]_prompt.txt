Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 7:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 8:
Text: Terms like "elected", "responsible" and "designated points-of-contact" imply some sort of delegated authority, I'd have thought.  By omission, is Hornoir saying that the delegate has authority over other aspects of the project?

Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 22:
Text: Unfortunately, I'm still worried this may not be enough to avoid arguments.  <url> says "A separate rationale must be provided each time the image is used in an article."  Should we just copy the tag for every article using the logo?
Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 23:
Text: News coverage would be spotty at best... you would have to go through the stats pages and do it by hand pretty much, so any of the Calgary/Edmonton Sun, Herald or Journal would suffice.  Maybe just send the AJHL an email and ask them?
Annotation from annotator: 19

Example 24:
Text: Also, all in all, I think Batman should be changed to <url>, not <url>, as the latter refers to those with superhuman powers or abilities, which he lacks. Thoughts?
