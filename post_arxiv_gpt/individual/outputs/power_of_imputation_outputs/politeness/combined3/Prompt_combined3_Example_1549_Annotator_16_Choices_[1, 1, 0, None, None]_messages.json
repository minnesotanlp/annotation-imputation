Maybe just send the AJHL an email and ask them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: I wasn't planning on it before I asked you about it. I figured, afterwards, why inquire if the template's really too long as it is?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 25:\nText: Ok, I'd agree about <url> being better.
