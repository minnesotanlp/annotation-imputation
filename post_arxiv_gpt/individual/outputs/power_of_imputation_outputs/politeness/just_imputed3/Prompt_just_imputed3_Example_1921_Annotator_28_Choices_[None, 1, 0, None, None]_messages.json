Want to check it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hey Dan, I see you around but we haven't talked in a bit. What are you up to these days?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi, I've reverted the edits you made to <url> as the flags by the clubs put's the box totally out of sync (on explorer anyway). Can I suggest that you don't add these flags?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi, although I agree with you, please check the following <url> in process. Why can't the darn thing work, in the first place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 6:\nText: I was wondering where you got your information for the dice statistics you recently added/changed in <url>.

Rather not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 10:\nText: Sorry, I dont quite remember what we were talking about.

Not too soon, correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thanks, firstly, for the affirmation and work on <url>; it was yesterday's featured article!

Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: News coverage would be spotty at best... you would have to go through the stats pages and do it by hand pretty much, so any of the Calgary/Edmonton Sun, Herald or Journal would suffice.  Maybe just send the AJHL an email and ask them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: I understand ''your'' position, however I disagree with it, even regarding the spirit. <ins>Mostly because I don't see linking something as modification of the quote, therefore it's a moot point, even when coupled with bracketed additions.</ins> Perhaps we should see<ins>k</ins> comments from additional editors?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sure, but what's the deal with fair use and cropping?  I thought the Zatanna one got removed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: Thanks for your reply.
