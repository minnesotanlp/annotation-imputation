Mind <url> so we can discuss?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 2:\nText: Hello Jeffq, I noticed you revert vandalism occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account <url> to help you revert vandalism more easily?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 3:\nText: I'll have a look (probably just for copyediting duties) once Zag has finished the larger changes. Keep me posted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 4:\nText: What about the whole \"Heroes as personal feifdom\" trip? Or are you ok with that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 5:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 6:\nText: Thoughts? Preferences?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 7:\nText: Done. Comments?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm sorry, but I'm unlikely to have time to help. Maybe try <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: No, I didn't know that. Where does this \"rule\" come from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 10:\nText: I deleted the redirects <url> and <url> that were a result of the page moves.  Is that all you needed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 11:\nText: So, I'm a \"deletion fanatic\"? Why don't you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hey, I saw you have re-direcred the 'Cheers' article, and I had a look to see how detailed it is, and saw that it well, wasn't very detailed. But yesterday I created the <url> for it and it has a lot more information about it that the current one, and was wondering if it is notable enough to be re-opened with?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 14:\nText: I think you're referring to <url>? For example, <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: Once upon a time (about 6 years ago), you uploaded <url>. Would you happen to remember where you got it from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 16:\nText: Regarding <url>: you closed it as no consensus, and I admit its close, but there are four well thought out deletes and only three keeps don't (in my view) present any clear arguments. Do you mind taking another look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: As a side note, I'm slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to \"encourage\" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the \"mocking\" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 18:\nText: I'm not sure what you mean by the old factory farming discussion. Is something missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 19:\nText: What has this got to do with the article? Is this in the right place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 20:\nText: Unless you provide a wikipedia article, with solid references od proof of notability of the term, I am going to delist it. I ave no doubts that there was a dilike of Portugals (like any other major nation), but was this word in notable circulation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 21:\nText: Well, OTRS is multilingual, so she could contact OTRS in Turkish and people would be able to deal with the issue there. What was the exact wording of her \"release\" of the images?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 22:\nText: Does that mean all the realiable sources are incorrect too? Was the e-mail from a reliable source?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 23:\nText: On second thought, the mix of pseudo-politeness, vulgarity and threats is...really creepy. Could ya...stop?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 24:\nText: It appears that that article was deleted because not enough info was found on the person. Doesn't the new article have enough info?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 25:\nText: I dunno, but this one reeks of that banned user <url> - same mark-as-minor edits, same targets. Care for a look at this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: So both of us already broke 3RR.  Do you want to esclate it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 27:\nText: Another question: Does \"Senn\" exist in Japanese? If it does, is it possible to render Sennin as Senn-in?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 28:\nText: Hi. I would argue that a consensus is far from being reached, so I'm wondering why you have went ahead and starting changing links?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 29:\nText: Why are you putting <nowiki><person></nowiki> on several pages related with Yu-musicians? IMO this is a pretty <strike>stup</strike> meaningless stub to have; why not <nowiki><person></nowiki> instead?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 30:\nText: How did you learn Interlingua?  Was it an online course like lernu, or what?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Hello.
