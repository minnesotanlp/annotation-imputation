Why can't the darn thing work, in the first place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 6:\nText: I was wondering where you got your information for the dice statistics you recently added/changed in <url>.  Can you add a source to those tables?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Yes, this is the English Wikipedia so we use the English version of the infobox. And can there once be a time when you don't find your way to my talk a complain?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: Your <url> is a brilliant idea! Would you mind if I linked to it from my collection of \"Useful things\" on my user page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 9:\nText: When am I changing nationalities? I do remove flags when I encounter them per <url> and <url>, but changing them...?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 10:\nText: You deleted this, but somehow it still shows up on the parent category's page <url>.  Is this normal and/or can you fix this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: Your POV tag justified. Did you get any support for cleaning it up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hello Jeffq, I noticed you revert vandalism occasionally.

Do you feel these sources establish <url> as being notable (<url> and all that)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 14:\nText: You deleted Ricardo Marinello. What was written in the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 15:\nText: I found an autoblock and cleared it.  Can you edit now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 16:\nText: Please explain this <url>. Is there a valid reason why this image was removed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 17:\nText: It turns out that the Zelda Collection you referred to in <url> didn't include aLttP, reportedly because the GBA remake was still being sold at that time, so that disc included NES and N64 emulation but left out SNES. Do you have another example?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 18:\nText: I don't understand the reason for <url>. Would you please explain it to me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 19:\nText: btw, do you think we should mention the effect right off the bat of the descripition(seeing as \"effect\" is listed right above it???\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 20:\nText: Also, why is this glorious photo of a <url> not used in any articles?

Do you have MSN Messenger?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: Correcting an article to remove mention of something that ''was made up here in Wikipedia'' and does not exist in any formal definition of the article's subject is a furtherance of the <url> policy, not vandalism.  Are you interested in knee-jerk reverting, or in actually making your encyclopedia correct and accurate?\nAnnotation from annotator: 2\n\nExample 24:\nText: You sure kill educating information. I wounder why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 25:\nText: Ok, I'd agree about <url> being better.
