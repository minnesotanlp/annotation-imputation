Can you edit now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 16:\nText: The file above does not meet the <url> so as to be copyrighted or eligible for fair use, as I had stated so on <url> when I first moved it there. What issues should be resolved?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 17:\nText: Upon further thought, maybe I could look through lists of deleted articles to see if any interest me and see if I can bring them back (with adequate sourcing). Do you know anything about that process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 18:\nText: It does not appear to have attracted any participants other than Gerda.

Is this the case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sure, but what's the deal with fair use and cropping?  I thought the Zatanna one got removed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 26:\nText: Like most users with their articles screwed over by <url>'s new web facelift, I'm at a lost with <url> being dead.
