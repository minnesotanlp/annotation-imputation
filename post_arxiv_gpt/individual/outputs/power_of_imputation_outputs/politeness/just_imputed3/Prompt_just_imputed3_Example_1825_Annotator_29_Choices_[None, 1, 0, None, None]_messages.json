Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 25:\nText: LOL, I can't believe you reverted Kizzle's deletion of my summary at S & aQ. Did you actually like my summary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 26:\nText: Like most users with their articles screwed over by <url>'s new web facelift, I'm at a lost with <url> being dead. Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: I've never seen something go beyond AN/I myself, and I find it hard to believe the other two hadn't been tried by now.
