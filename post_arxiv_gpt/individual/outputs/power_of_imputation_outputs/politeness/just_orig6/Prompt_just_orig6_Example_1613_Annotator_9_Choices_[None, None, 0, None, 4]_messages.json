If we're going to delete every fair use image that ''has'' a sufficient rationale, why not change to German Wikipedia image policy already?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nIf you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset."
