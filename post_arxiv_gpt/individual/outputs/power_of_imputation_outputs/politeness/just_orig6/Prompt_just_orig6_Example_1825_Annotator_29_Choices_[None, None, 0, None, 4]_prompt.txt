Target Example:
Text: I want to send you a private message, but you don't have an e-mail address registered with your Wikipedia account. How could I contact you?
Annotation from annotator:
If you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset.
