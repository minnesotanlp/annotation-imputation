In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Target Example:
Text: I plan on getting the page up at some point this weekend, no latter than Monday though for obvious reasons. Why do you ask?
Annotation from annotator:
If you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset.
