In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Target Example:
Text: Delete, who cares. If we're going to delete every fair use image that ''has'' a sufficient rationale, why not change to German Wikipedia image policy already?
Annotation from annotator:
If you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset.
