In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Target Example:
Text: You said you were promoting them, but, um... they aren't listed at <url>, they still say they're FPOCs on their talk pages, etc, etc. Should we consider them featured or not?
Annotation from annotator:
If you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset.
