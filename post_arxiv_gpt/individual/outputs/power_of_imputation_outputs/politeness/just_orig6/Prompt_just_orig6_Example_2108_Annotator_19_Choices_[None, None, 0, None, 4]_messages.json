Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \"naming\" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nIf you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset."
