In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Target Example:
Text: I don't think I've used it in Wikipedia.  So, if I haven't, why did you bring it up?
Annotation from annotator:
If you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset.
