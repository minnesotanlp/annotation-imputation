Annotation from annotator: 17

Example 7:
Text: I had an editorial dispute with a user called <url><, but I'm not responding to him anymore as it seems to escalate into heated arguments. If he keeps messaging, would it be ok if I got back in touch with you and you had a word with him?

Example 8:
Text: In <url>, you removed a cartoon image of Wendy Thomas that had been used in the infobox on her article. I'm not very familiar with the NFCC policy you cite, so I was wondering if you thought that giving a rationale on the image for use in that particular article would bring it up to specs?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 9:
Text: Hello, sorry I probably should have asked first, but I thought it might be a good idea to nominate one of the images you uploaded, <url>, for featured picture. I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty, as it were?

Annotation from annotator: 9

Example 12:
Text: At <url>, your 'outside comment' contains the statement "You don't go deleting things with a consensus, and then blast those who have the nerve to reprimand you. "  This seems self-contradictory: did you mean to type 'without'?

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 17:
Text: As a side note, I'm slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to "encourage" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the "mocking" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps?

Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 23:
Text: I just thought that it is nice when you are looking for RQ that you can find an algorithm that will do RQ, not QR.  It's fine if we just make a section about RQ in the QR article, is that ok with you?

Example 27:
Text: You just created that article - but maybe you haven't noticed there's already <url>, which covers the same character set, as the ISO followed the Thai standard. Maybe you should merge your additions there, and make TIS-620 a redirect?
