What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: Hello-I think you know more about <url> than I do. Want to check it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 3:\nText: What is the most common way to spell the first paragraph of an intro? is it \"lede\" or \"lead\" or something else?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 4:\nText: I restored 3 non-piped blue links.  How does that look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 5:\nText: Could you please explain <url> to me?

Could you tell me how you do them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 8:\nText: Your <url> is a brilliant idea! Would you mind if I linked to it from my collection of \"Useful things\" on my user page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 9:\nText: Hey how are you? Now I can't find you online, where are you lol?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: OK, then, define \"bias\", propose a way to quantify it, and if it's accepted by consensus, we'll apply it to ''all'' the admins on that page. Or, perhaps as a starting point, how about presenting some evidence?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 11:\nText: I've been meaning to add soundclips to the Suede and Stone Roses articles (3u20134 for each). I can get to it over the weekend; suggestions?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 12:\nText: Just had a look at <url>, and oh dear god. Any interest?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 13:\nText: Just letting you know (since you have mentioned AFDing <url>) that weu2019ve gone to some effort to establish notability with <url>, and have added three reliable, notable, third-party sources to the article.  Do you feel these sources establish <url> as being notable (<url> and all that)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Is 10 months sufficient time to relist a AFD?  Not too soon, correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 15:\nText: I really would rather use, in English, the one expression \"<url>\" instead of \"<url>,\" \"marz,\" \"<url>,\" \"khaet,\" \"<url>,\" \"eparchia,\" \"ostan,\" \"khoueng,\" \"faritany,\" \"aimag,\" \"tinh\"u2014or \"<url>\" (aka \"<url>\").  <url> then why should \"<url>\" not be also?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 16:\nText: I noticed you've been adding the template <person> to pages - I'm sure there's a good reason but I'm totally puzzled as to why. Can you explain what it does?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 17:\nText: Since the \"discussion\" was not advertised at the affected pages, it did not involve the \"community\". Do you not see that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 18:\nText: True, tho in reality I should have just blocked the sock tpar from the beginning.
