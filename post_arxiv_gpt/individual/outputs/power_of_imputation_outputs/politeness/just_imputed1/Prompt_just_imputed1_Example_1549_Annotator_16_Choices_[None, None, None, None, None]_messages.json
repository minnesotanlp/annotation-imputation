What do you say?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: Hello-I think you know more about <url> than I do. Want to check it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 3:\nText: I've heard about the controversy. What's your take on it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 4:\nText: I restored 3 non-piped blue links.  How does that look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: Could you please explain <url> to me? I don't see how deleting a person's userpage is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 6:\nText: And  what did I do wrong???????????????????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 7:\nText: This is what you stated from the page <url>.  Can you link to me the policy stating that minimum amount of content in an article, where it's not 'lacking in content,' is needed to be considered undue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hmm...I was not aware that a year had to pass for ''anyone'' to request an appeal for Everyking. Prior to today, when did they ever say this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 9:\nText: I was just looking again at the April Fool's pranks from this year and came upon <url> to a page you deleted per \"housecleaning\".

Is this normal and/or can you fix this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: I had some problems updating images in the <url> FAC. The images are uploaded both on Wikipedia and on Wikimedia Commons under the same name ... how do I get the links on the page to connect to the Wikimedia images rather than the Wikipedia ones?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 12:\nText: I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 13:\nText: that hotcat lockup, was like an edit conflict, so i tried a backup and re-enter.  thanks for the assistance, i'm using the old layout, so would the new view affect my hotcat category edits?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 14:\nText: Is 10 months sufficient time to relist a AFD?  Not too soon, correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thanks, firstly, for the affirmation and work on <url>; it was yesterday's featured article! As a related article, I've been working on <url> - what do you think would be necessary to get it to FA?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 16:\nText: I am planning on changing the <url> to the ICF Flatwater World Championships. Any objections?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 17:\nText: I wonder, did anyone add new links leading to the portal?  Is there an easy way to check this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 18:\nText: Personally I think (much) longer gallery captions are probably the answer; these are probably easier than working each image into the text.

Do you have MSN Messenger?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: News coverage would be spotty at best... you would have to go through the stats pages and do it by hand pretty much, so any of the Calgary/Edmonton Sun, Herald or Journal would suffice.  Maybe just send the AJHL an email and ask them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: I wasn't planning on it before I asked you about it. I figured, afterwards, why inquire if the template's really too long as it is?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 25:\nText: Ok, I'd agree about <url> being better. Should I delete the other one (you could also tag it for speedy deletion as a mistake)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: So you're interested in both Amiga computers and BDSM! Are you an atheist too?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 27:\nText: I've never seen something go beyond AN/I myself, and I find it hard to believe the other two hadn't been tried by now.
