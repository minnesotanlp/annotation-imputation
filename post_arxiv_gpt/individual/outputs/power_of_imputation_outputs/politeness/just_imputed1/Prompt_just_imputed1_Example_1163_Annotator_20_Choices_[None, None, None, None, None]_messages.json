In the process, have I missed anything out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 3:\nText: you need a copy, you say... by that you mean a translation, or one which has been reconstructed to meet en. wiki coding?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: Again, what would be the point of redirection? Who on earth is going to fall on the redirect first?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 5:\nText: Could you please explain <url> to me? I don't see how deleting a person's userpage is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 6:\nText: And  what did I do wrong???????????????????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 7:\nText: Heh, thanks. Do you know of any scripts that might come in handy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: Your <url> is a brilliant idea! Would you mind if I linked to it from my collection of \"Useful things\" on my user page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 9:\nText: Agreed. Why do we even waste our time discussing afd's, if consensus has no bearing on the result?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 10:\nText: You deleted this, but somehow it still shows up on the parent category's page <url>.  Is this normal and/or can you fix this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: Technically, Taku is within his rights to change things to conform to an existing standard, but it's not very politic of him to do so; if we decide to change, then it's still more meaningless work to change everything once again. Unfortunately, it's all too common for editors to edit first and talk second, eh?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hello Jeffq, I noticed you revert vandalism occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account <url> to help you revert vandalism more easily?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 13:\nText: Nice to see you editing in article space! We have been chipping away at your compiled OBI list - can you believe it's almost done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 14:\nText: BTW, I'm not certain that Queen Victoria can be described as being the Founder without being somewhat misleading. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thanks, was getting worried there for a moment. Have you though of asking Outriggr for a hand with <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 16:\nText: Yeah, and it will still have been the third to pass the full bit string tests, instead of just the byte tests. :)   What's the significance of 2042?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: It turns out that the Zelda Collection you referred to in <url> didn't include aLttP, reportedly because the GBA remake was still being sold at that time, so that disc included NES and N64 emulation but left out SNES. Do you have another example?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 18:\nText: Do your sources have the dates of birth and death for <url>, which I just created? And, while I'm on the topic, any information regarding his playing career (if applicable)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 19:\nText: The <url> has a request (header \"<url>\") left a few hours ago by someone who has pictures of signs in China but can't read them.  Would you please be willing to help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 20:\nText: Just saw your message on <url>. Shall I carry on the review, or shall I wait for a cue from your side when you're ready to carry on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 21:\nText: To me these two bits of TeX look identical after they're rendered.  Can you explain the advantage of the latter format (since you've made a point of changing from the first to the second form in some articles)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 22:\nText: Unfortunately, I'm still worried this may not be enough to avoid arguments.  <url> says \"A separate rationale must be provided each time the image is used in an article.\"  Should we just copy the tag for every article using the logo?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 23:\nText: <url>. Congrats, or should I say good luck?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: Hi, what I'm trying to establish is a reference for the assertion that Swails \"may have been the first <url> commissioned as a officer in the <url> during the <url>\". Does your source say that specifically?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 25:\nText: LOL, I can't believe you reverted Kizzle's deletion of my summary at S & aQ. Did you actually like my summary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 26:\nText: So you're interested in both Amiga computers and BDSM! Are you an atheist too?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 27:\nText: Have a look at the edit to <url>. Is this page even a dab?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: I am not sure what are rules about GA in en.wiki but for me <url> is really outdated and it shouldn`t have GA sign. What you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 29:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 30:\nText: Checkuser shows the three users share an ip from time to time. How serious is the problem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nText: I agreed from my very first post on the first subject that it shouldn't be included yet you and the other user continued to misrepresent my position. Would you disagree with that?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
