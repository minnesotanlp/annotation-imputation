In this dataset, annotators are asked whether text is offensive. There are three possible labels: not offensive (0), maybe (1), offensive (2)

Target Example:
Text: feelings of resentment have been ' riffling ' through the orlando gay community since omar mateen first set foot in the pulse nightclub .
Annotation from annotator:
If you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset.
