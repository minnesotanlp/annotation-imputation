In this dataset, annotators are asked whether text is offensive. There are three possible labels: not offensive (0), maybe (1), offensive (2)

Human-rated Examples: (there may not be any)


Target Example:
Text: what time do the japanese go to the dentist ? <number>
Annotation from annotator:
If you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset.
