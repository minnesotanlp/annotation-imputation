In this dataset, annotators are asked whether text is offensive. There are three possible labels: not offensive (0), maybe (1), offensive (2)

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: why was't jesus born in mexico ? they could n't find three wise men or a virgin .
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer and nothing else.
