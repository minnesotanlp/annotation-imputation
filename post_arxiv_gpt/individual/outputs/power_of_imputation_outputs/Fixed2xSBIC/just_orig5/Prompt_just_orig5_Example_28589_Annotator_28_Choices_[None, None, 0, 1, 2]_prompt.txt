In this dataset, annotators are asked whether text is offensive. There are three possible labels: not offensive (0), maybe (1), offensive (2)

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: what 's the difference between three dicks and a joke ? my wife ca n't take a joke .
Annotation from annotator:
The only valid output is a single integer.
