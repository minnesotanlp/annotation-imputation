Your output should be an integer label:\nTarget Example:\nText: mexican jokes why are there no good mexican athletes ? because anyone who can run , jump , or swim has already crossed the border what 's a mexican 's favorite bookstore for those who can read ? borders\nAnnotation from annotator:\nThe only valid output is a single integer."
