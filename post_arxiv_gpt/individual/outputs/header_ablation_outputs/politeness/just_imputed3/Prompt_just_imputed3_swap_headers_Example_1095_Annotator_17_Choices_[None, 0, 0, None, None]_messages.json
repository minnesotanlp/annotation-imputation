Should Wikipedia have a dedicated sunrise article that does not feature even one single decent image of a red sky?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 2:\nText: I was really unsure on what to do with <url> so I made it into a dab. That ok?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: you need a copy, you say... by that you mean a translation, or one which has been reconstructed to meet en. wiki coding?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: Again, what would be the point of redirection? Who on earth is going to fall on the redirect first?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi, although I agree with you, please check the following <url> in process. Why can't the darn thing work, in the first place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 6:\nText: I was wondering where you got your information for the dice statistics you recently added/changed in <url>.  Can you add a source to those tables?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hi.  Why did you blank the redirect at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hmm...I was not aware that a year had to pass for ''anyone'' to request an appeal for Everyking. Prior to today, when did they ever say this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 9:\nText: Agreed. Why do we even waste our time discussing afd's, if consensus has no bearing on the result?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: That's basically what our members have said, not necessarily my opinion. Anything I miss?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 11:\nText: Could you please explain to me what the buttons do? How do you \"Not accept\" a change, that's what...you revert it, don't you...?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 12:\nText: There's enough subtlety on some of the variants that I will need help from an expert. Might you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 13:\nText: Nice to see you editing in article space! We have been chipping away at your compiled OBI list - can you believe it's almost done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 14:\nText: BTW, I'm not certain that Queen Victoria can be described as being the Founder without being somewhat misleading. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thanks, was getting worried there for a moment. Have you though of asking Outriggr for a hand with <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 16:\nText: Yeah, and it will still have been the third to pass the full bit string tests, instead of just the byte tests. :)   What's the significance of 2042?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: It turns out that the Zelda Collection you referred to in <url> didn't include aLttP, reportedly because the GBA remake was still being sold at that time, so that disc included NES and N64 emulation but left out SNES. Do you have another example?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 18:\nText: I don't know why claim that you reverted vandalism (rv edit summary) when to me they appeared to be good faith edits.

What are you accusing me of doing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 20:\nText: Just saw your message on <url>. Shall I carry on the review, or shall I wait for a cue from your side when you're ready to carry on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 21:\nText: To me these two bits of TeX look identical after they're rendered.  Can you explain the advantage of the latter format (since you've made a point of changing from the first to the second form in some articles)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 22:\nText: <url> needs urdu script for the name of the subject (Bangla script has already been added). Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 23:\nText: <url>. Congrats, or should I say good luck?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 24:\nText: Many people have mentioned this mythical facillity - I've never found it, and assumed it was only available to sysops, which I am not. Is this the case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sure, but what's the deal with fair use and cropping?  I thought the Zatanna one got removed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 26:\nText: Thank you for removing the \"Speedy Deletion\" from my post. I realise that I still need to do more work on the post itself, but are the sources that I am using acceptable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 27:\nText: Question: how do we move the content from the existing page to the new page?  How do we reference the space to the new page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 28:\nText: I am not sure what are rules about GA in en.wiki but for me <url> is really outdated and it shouldn`t have GA sign.
