Could you perhaps link to the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 2:\nText: Your \"resolution\" was to move it back to \"Detective Terry Crowley\" again? Why do you keep doing that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 3:\nText: My question about the truncation operation is to understand the generic algorithm for applying a ring (or un-ringing) a Dynkin node. What method (code) do you use to get the higher dimensions truncated based on the Coxeter Dynkin ringed nodes?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 4:\nText: We've got few like this on the horizon and I'm not sure how to approach it. Do we default keep them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hope you had a good trip. Are you able to take a further look now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 6:\nText: Actually it was a compliment. Does that count as an 'issue'?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 7:\nText: She did so in Switzerland. What makes you think a photo that was deemed not to be a \"work\" in Switzerland was not a work in the U.S., where the threshold of originality is much lower?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hello? Whom do I speak to to become a <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 9:\nText: Actually, I was referring to all of the redlinks within the article. Is that not the correct Template to use in that case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 10:\nText: According to <url>, links are permissible as part of your signature but be sure to check the \"'''Sign my name exactly as shown'''\" box.  What happens when you load '''<nowiki><url><url> (<url>)</nowiki>''' into the signature window and check the box?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 11:\nText: I \"voted\" weak keep, based on what I've found.  Can you comment?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 12:\nText: Where is the vandalism? Diffs?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Point taken. Would you like to be a mod?\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer corresponding to the label."
