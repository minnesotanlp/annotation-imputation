In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around "naming" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer corresponding to the label.
