In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: You said you were promoting them, but, um... they aren't listed at <url>, they still say they're FPOCs on their talk pages, etc, etc. Should we consider them featured or not?
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer and nothing else.
