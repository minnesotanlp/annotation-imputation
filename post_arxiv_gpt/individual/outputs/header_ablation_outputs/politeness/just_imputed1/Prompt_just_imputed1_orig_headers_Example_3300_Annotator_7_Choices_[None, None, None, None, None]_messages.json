Why don't you re-post it there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 2:\nText: No, I didn't know that. Where does this \"rule\" come from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 3:\nText: I was starting bio...bio-something's talk page, telling him to make it an article, not a user page, and I saw that you wanted to delete it.  Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi, the article states that Mongolian Cyrillic is a phonemic script. Is this so in respect to Inner Mongolian dialects?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 5:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 6:\nText: It has been a pleasure working with you on the Burma campaign. What is your source for the Japanese information you have been adding as the books I have been reading on the subject are all from a British or American perspective?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 7:\nText: I had an editorial dispute with a user called <url><, but I'm not responding to him anymore as it seems to escalate into heated arguments. If he keeps messaging, would it be ok if I got back in touch with you and you had a word with him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 8:\nText: In <url>, you removed a cartoon image of Wendy Thomas that had been used in the infobox on her article. I'm not very familiar with the NFCC policy you cite, so I was wondering if you thought that giving a rationale on the image for use in that particular article would bring it up to specs?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 9:\nText: Hello, sorry I probably should have asked first, but I thought it might be a good idea to nominate one of the images you uploaded, <url>, for featured picture. I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty, as it were?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 10:\nText: Check out the devanagari on Heart Sutra. Is that what you wanted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Back on topic Jigglyfidders; I totally agree with Deconstructhis on this one. What will you do to address this issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 12:\nText: At <url>, your 'outside comment' contains the statement \"You don't go deleting things with a consensus, and then blast those who have the nerve to reprimand you. \"  This seems self-contradictory: did you mean to type 'without'?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 13:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 14:\nText: No, just admire them from a distance of a couple of centuries! You?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 15:\nText: Yesterday you undid an edit of mine (on the <url> article). What did you mean by \"a COI link\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 16:\nText: I wish I could find a better one but I don't think I know where one is I think the composition needs more information. Can you do that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 17:\nText: As a side note, I'm slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to \"encourage\" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the \"mocking\" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 18:\nText: I'm not sure what you mean by the old factory farming discussion. Is something missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 19:\nText: He's stumped about what the block is for, and so am I. Could you clarify?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 20:\nText: Sorry to bother you but theres a report on <url> regarding <url> which has been a target for IP vandalism. I'm only asking directly  because the vandalism is continuing and I'm close to not being able to fight it anymore under policy so can I ask if you could please issue the protection and revert the IP's vandalism back to my last revision?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 21:\nText: Hi, I see that you added the etymology section of the <url> article.  What does \"RatCE\" mean?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: Does that mean all the realiable sources are incorrect too? Was the e-mail from a reliable source?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 23:\nText: I just thought that it is nice when you are looking for RQ that you can find an algorithm that will do RQ, not QR.  It's fine if we just make a section about RQ in the QR article, is that ok with you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 24:\nText: It appears that that article was deleted because not enough info was found on the person. Doesn't the new article have enough info?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 25:\nText: OK, the 3920th is done. Any further thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: Just in case you haven't seen it. I wondered if you might even respond to the comments there?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 27:\nText: You just created that article - but maybe you haven't noticed there's already <url>, which covers the same character set, as the ISO followed the Thai standard. Maybe you should merge your additions there, and make TIS-620 a redirect?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 28:\nText: Hi. I would argue that a consensus is far from being reached, so I'm wondering why you have went ahead and starting changing links?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 29:\nText: Hi the table you removed was added after a discussion <url>, so please give us a reason why you removed it??\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 30:\nText: I was thinking on it, but one question: I see several articles either deleted or promoted to FA after the oldid the sweeps uses. I'm assuming we simply ignore these?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nText: comment from a member of the Article Rescue Squadron? Do you know how to hide a human body?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
