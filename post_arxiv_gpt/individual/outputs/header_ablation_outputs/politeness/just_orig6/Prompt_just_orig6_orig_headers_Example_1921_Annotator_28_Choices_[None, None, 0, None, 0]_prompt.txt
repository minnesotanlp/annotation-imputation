In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

Target Example:
Text: At <url>, your 'outside comment' contains the statement "You don't go deleting things with a consensus, and then blast those who have the nerve to reprimand you. "  This seems self-contradictory: did you mean to type 'without'?
Annotation from annotator:
