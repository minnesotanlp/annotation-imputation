Did I mention that she was in?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 3:\nText: On another note, I'm going to assume that you were the one who also added ridership data for various LIRR stations, am I correct? If so, could you kindly point me towards your source?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 4:\nText: I restored 3 non-piped blue links.  How does that look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 5:\nText: Could you please explain <url> to me? I don't see how deleting a person's userpage is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 6:\nText: And  what did I do wrong???????????????????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 7:\nText: You told me to message you in here. Could you tell me how you do them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 8:\nText: Your <url> is a brilliant idea! Would you mind if I linked to it from my collection of \"Useful things\" on my user page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 9:\nText: Hey how are you? Now I can't find you online, where are you lol?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 10:\nText: OK, then, define \"bias\", propose a way to quantify it, and if it's accepted by consensus, we'll apply it to ''all'' the admins on that page. Or, perhaps as a starting point, how about presenting some evidence?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: I had some problems updating images in the <url> FAC. The images are uploaded both on Wikipedia and on Wikimedia Commons under the same name ... how do I get the links on the page to connect to the Wikimedia images rather than the Wikipedia ones?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 12:\nText: No, I didn't know that. Where does this \"rule\" come from?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 13:\nText: On the third reading... Why not include an edit summary that tells me this?

Now, if I had to make an infobox on \"London\" (just ''London'', I know there are many terms: Greater London, City of London etc), would it be correct to include the area/population/density of the territories I mentioned + the city area, or would just the city area suffice?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 16:\nText: I noticed you've been adding the template <person> to pages - I'm sure there's a good reason but I'm totally puzzled as to why. Can you explain what it does?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 17:\nText: Since the \"discussion\" was not advertised at the affected pages, it did not involve the \"community\". Do you not see that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 18:\nText: It does not appear to have attracted any participants other than Gerda.

Would you care to address any of the other points I've brought up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: Also, all in all, I think Batman should be changed to <url>, not <url>, as the latter refers to those with superhuman powers or abilities, which he lacks. Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: LOL, I can't believe you reverted Kizzle's deletion of my summary at S & aQ. Did you actually like my summary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 26:\nText: Yellowmonkey has told me we need another FAR delegate and recommended you for the job. Is that something you're willing to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 27:\nText: I've never seen something go beyond AN/I myself, and I find it hard to believe the other two hadn't been tried by now. Or is it a case-by-case thing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 28:\nText: I am not sure what are rules about GA in en.wiki but for me <url> is really outdated and it shouldn`t have GA sign.

Any ideas?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hi J.  I'm thinking it might be a bad idea to start linking all unnamed EP recordings to the EP dab page.  Could turn into a very massive list, and maybe not the right use for a dab page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 4:\nText: I finished my expansion of the category you created. Any suggestions on how to improve the category?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: If the llamas of Peru spoke Spanish, and one asked the other, ''xbfCxf3mo se llama?'', would he get confused?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: In the article on <url>, you recently replaced a non-free image with J.

Could you properly nominate this for deletion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 8:\nText: Hello-I think you know more about <url> than I do. Want to check it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 9:\nText: Hey, I just went ahead and reverted <url>.

However, there is all this content under the statistics section that is uncited, and wanted to know if someone would help me find sources for this information, or challenge and remove it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 12:\nText: I was wondering why you removed him from Category:Alameda. He's pretty famous around there and it would be notable to have him in the category of Alameda, wouldn't it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I think I have a general idea what this is supposed to mean, but not nearly close enough to attempt a rewrite by myself. Are we talking about a piano trio sitting around \"naming\" trios that they might want to play, or record, or just playing the sort of game that parents use to keep young kids amused on a long trip (or did before there were TVs and movies inside cars)?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
