Would you be able to delete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 2:\nText: I am the uploader of the hubble pictures.  What do I put for the author, description, and the other information?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 3:\nText: That's reason to expand the treatment to other painters, not to blank this one.  And you didn't think that there would be more articles on van Gogh paintings?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: If you are referring to the page blanking, that has been rectified.  What other concerns do have about the content?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 5:\nText: How exactly is a one-time martial arts tournament, all of whose participants are red-links, notable? Is Wikipedia to have separate articles for every martial arts tournament ever broadcast on television?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 6:\nText: Thanks for improving the article.  Can you add categories also?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 7:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 8:\nText: you need a copy, you say... by that you mean a translation, or one which has been reconstructed to meet en. wiki coding?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 9:\nText: You created this template, but it is only used in one article. Do you intend to expand its use, or is it not required?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 10:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 11:\nText: Let's go back to what you want to add now while I find that notice.  Which source gives what specific information you wish to add to the article right now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hey Alex... I just emailed a United Kingdom professor, intending to email a University of Kentucky professor. If he expresses interest, are you the person he should talk to?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 13:\nText: I only used approved templates.  If they are not considered polite, why have them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hello Glacier109, I am contacting you because in golf they put Money not Winnings as the standard on most leaderboards used at the end of tournaments.  I am just wondering why you selected the word winnings?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: ?????????????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 16:\nText: Sorry for the delay in responding. The problems seems to have calmed down at this point, is that correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hi SE7 - There's some vandalism coming from your account, see <url>.  As your past history doesn't seem to fit with this, has someoen either hacked your account or a logged-in session?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 18:\nText: Thank you for your answer about Illustrator.  How does Adobe Illustrator compare with InDesign?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 19:\nText: I'm not sure what needs doing now, or if there are further modifications required (this is the first article I've ever nominated for GA). Is there anything you can point me in the direction of?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 20:\nText: Restored history. Can check that I did it all ok?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: Listen, the reason I put those signs in the code 'break-clear' is because the arrangement of the blocks is ''off-key'', at least when looking through IE or Mozilla. Why are you taking them off?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 22:\nText: I hardly ever agree with Jimintheatl, but that block was bordering on absurd. Fast on the button much?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 23:\nText: I'm trying to figure out what he did differently from any of the other editors continually arguing (for months) about the South Ossetia War. Sure, he argues passionately for his viewpoint, but hasn't everyone that was involved in that article done so, including myself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 24:\nText: Bob,  Have now actioned the above.  Are there any further railway references that you consider weak or missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 25:\nText: Would you like to elaborate? How are you empowering me exactly?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: You left some comments at <url>, specifically about referencing. I've added some references to the sections you outlined and was wondering if it addressed your concerns enough for you to give the article your support?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 27:\nText: Thank you very much for fixing the broken references in <url> and related articles. Are you planning to fix them in <url> as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 28:\nText: if you think \"Sheffer Stroke\" is less common than \"Logical NAND\"??\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 29:\nText: You removed the border issue coverage in <url>, and your explanation was that it's covered in another article. Where is it covered?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 30:\nText: Hm. Am I imagining things, or does <url> seem familiar?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nEstimated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I notice that to the <url> and <url> pages edited '''''Gorka''''' '''Josxe9 Unda Velasco''' and changed it to simply ''Gorka''. Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: That's basically what our members have said, not necessarily my opinion. Anything I miss?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 3:\nText: The <url> page said that <url> will be shown on the <url> subchannels 26.5 and 26.6, and also on analog channel 48. It is also expected that The U Too will displace Me Too from analog channel 48. If that's the case, then, where do you suppose Me Too will end up? What new channel in Chicago will it be shown on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nExample 4:\nText: You make it very hard to believe that you're acting in good faith when you rewrite the <url> article to remove all references to \"liberal,\" but keep the phrase \"conservative Independence Institute.\"  I see POV-pushing when that happens.  If you're so concerned about adjectives, why not edit the articles about AEI or Heritage or Americans for Tax Reform?\nAnnotation from annotator: 2\n\nExample 5:\nText: I pretty much agree with <url>, except I would like to know why you modified the see also section to be a hatnote. Doesn't <url> have specific requirements for this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 6:\nText: Certainly the work is out of copyright, and some of the neighboring volumes in the series are visible on archive.org (and I don't have trouble with other books on google generally).  I wonder if you know of any way, or could suggest any way, that I could get to see the downloaded pdf of Newcomb vol.6?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nTarget Example:\nText: You said you were promoting them, but, um... they aren't listed at <url>, they still say they're FPOCs on their talk pages, etc, etc. Should we consider them featured or not?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
