Did I mention that she was in?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hi, this will seem a little odd, but your name seems very familiar. Did you ever play an online game named <url> by chance?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 4:\nText: Looking through the discussion page history, the addition was made by <url> who is still active on wikipedia. Why not try a message on <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 5:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 6:\nText: I just traced an IP you just blocked for six months, <url>, and it is a school IP. Is this block an anonymous only block, or is it a full block?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Miten sxe4 osaat nii hyvin suomee jos sun xe4idinkieli on kumminki englanti?

You seem to fill in a lot of things not said with your assumptions.\"'' on my talk?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 9:\nText: I think that if you use an example paragraph, and show the options in a nowiki tag, it will make it easier for people to \"vote\" for the method they like.

Understanding that this is a BLP, that NPOV is important, and that including secondary sources is nearly impossible as they are difficult (at best) to find, what is your feeling on this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 11:\nText: You see how time consuming and annoying it is when a person keeps on telling you to provide a source. Why do you want ''Michael'' to be just another compilation album?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 12:\nText: I wondered, simply because I see you occasionally and had never seen him before, so at first I thought he was you.  I wonder if there's a User:Nyttned running around?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 13:\nText: The Italian and English rules are different from the Spanish.

Can I proceed with a prod or AfD?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 15:\nText: The reason for the malfunctioning redirects is that the character immediately after \"REDIRECT\" is not an ordinary space, but a \"non-breaking space\", hex code 0xA0.  Out of curiosity: how did you manage to create them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 16:\nText: I was going to create the list of tallest buildings in Hartford, when I saw that it had been deleted three years ago by you. I don't understand the reason for deletion; can you clarify why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 17:\nText: Hi.

Don't you think being an admin you should delete them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 19:\nText: What do you think? Do these subdivisions make sense?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 20:\nText: Crimson, there is a discussion at <url> where we have implemented a new template for bot operators when their bot is blocked stating that it is in ''no way'' an indication or accusation of wrong doing on the operator's behalf. I'm sorry you have interpreted that way - would you be willing to re-consider your retirement?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 21:\nText: You didn't answer about the status of above mentioned image. Are you going to tag that image too?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 22:\nText: Do you really believe that your photograph at the top of the <url> is better than my photograph which you removed?

Please make it clearer to me how I vandalized?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 24:\nText: I thought that VAMOS section was dealing primarily with captions (perhaps a clearer wording is needed there?). Also, I have seen dates used as adjectives quite often - the \"1848 Revolution\", for example - where did you read about this rule?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 25:\nText: Hayashi and Spreng Explicitly claim that the Inuktitut data is completely compable to Greenlandic. When you write Mahieu & Tersis you mean Trondhjem right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 26:\nText: ? What?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 27:\nText: Thanks. Can I save your last line as ammo in my next edit war?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 28:\nText: David Sprenkle was at the University of Illinois in 1982 (at least part of it) while I was there.  Were you there too?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 29:\nText: ''You wrote:'' I'm not trying to be obtuse, but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn't apply because the assertion of notability has been made?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 30:\nText: How did you learn Interlingua?  Was it an online course like lernu, or what?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nEstimated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I am puzzled that you just deleted the file 'harry potter stamps'. This file seems to have existed for two years without deletion, so perhaps you could explain the grounds for speedy deletion?\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 2:\nText: Why do you contend that New Atheism and Atheism 3.0 are unrelated? They are so intermingled that people have difficulty discerning which is which?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: (undent) Your Chinese is much better than mine.

Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 6:\nText: You were asking for a source for the <url> mention of the <url> service to Lagos from March 29th, which you reverted.  Would <url> do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hi Steve, I've added refs & cites to this article. Do you think it still needs a warning about lack of refs/citations?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I very much disagree that the article that was deleted was advertising; I have never bought anything from his store as a matter of fact, but I do know that his is one of the most used online Judaica shops out there. What can I do to make the article acceptable?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
