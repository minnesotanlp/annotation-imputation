Annotation from annotator: 7

Text: As a side note, I'm slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to "encourage" the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the "mocking" part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps?
