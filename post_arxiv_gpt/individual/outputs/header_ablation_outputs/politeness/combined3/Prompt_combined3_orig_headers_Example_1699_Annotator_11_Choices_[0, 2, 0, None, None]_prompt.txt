Annotation from annotator: 8

Example 7:
Text: MONGO, today you speedied this article as a non notable character.  Surely you know the non notable speedy criteria is for real people, not characters?
Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 8:
Text: The article doesn't seem to imply that ''The Game Keeper'' was created by WotC, nor does it give a hint when the company bought the stores. Were you thinking of something specific I can change to make that more clear, or is it fine as-is?
Annotation from annotator: 10
