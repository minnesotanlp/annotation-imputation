Annotation from annotator: 5

Example 6:
Text: You just created that article - but maybe you haven't noticed there's already <url>, which covers the same character set, as the ISO followed the Thai standard. Maybe you should merge your additions there, and make TIS-620 a redirect?

Annotation from annotator: 11

Annotation from annotator: 18

Annotation from annotator: 13

Example 16:
Text: Okay. How's what I wrote on his talk page look?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 18:

Annotation from annotator: 5

Annotation from annotator: 13

Annotation from annotator: 6

Example 23:

Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 24:
Text: I notice yall were trying to get some Canadian articles featured. How many Canadian articles are even at that status?
Annotation from annotator: 10

Example 25:
Text: What a disturbing video. Maybe we should donate a few copies of <url> to CNN... And what's up with the 2 ad-breaks in 13 minutes?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 26:
Text: Hello. I was just wondering, is it really fair to delete an unintentional duplication of a deleted category without a formal CFD submission?
Annotation from annotator: 14

Example 27:
Text: I sort of liked the nav box for diabetes.  I am not sure how this could not be seen as the main topic area?
Annotation from annotator: 16

Example 28:

Annotation from annotator: 15

Example 29:

Example 30:
Text: I'm not trying to be obtuse, but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7? So if an assumption needs to be made, or discretion employed, A7 doesn't apply because the assertion of notability has been made?

Estimated Examples:
Example 1:

Text: One question - how come the page is marked as "in dispute"?  The data that is currently posted isn't in dispute, correct?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 3:
Text: I noticed that you did some work on this article, and would like to expand it to include his recommendation (in ''Can Life Prevail'') that the UN develop hit squads to target large urban population centers (with neutron bombs as I recall), and also the discussion on the 9/11 terrorists being "superior moral human beings" for their actions.  Understanding that this is a BLP, that NPOV is important, and that including secondary sources is nearly impossible as they are difficult (at best) to find, what is your feeling on this?
Annotation from annotator: 20

Example 4:
Text: Take a look at the standardisation i've implemented for federal elections 1972-2004 inclusive on <url>... i'm happy with where it's at for now, but that bloody 1990 page sticks out like a sore thumb! How do you reckon I would go about forming a second concensus?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Example 5:
Text: I think the story is worth recording, and I could add several more references.  I have to ask... are you related to Boyds, Smileys, or Souters?
Annotation from annotator: 12

Target Example:
Text: clear about when the inverse exists.  Is there a formal theorem that would apply?
