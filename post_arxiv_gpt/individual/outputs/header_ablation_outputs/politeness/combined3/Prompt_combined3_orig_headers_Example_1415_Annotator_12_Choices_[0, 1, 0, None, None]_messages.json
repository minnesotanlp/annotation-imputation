What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 2:\nText: That's reason to expand the treatment to other painters, not to blank this one.  And you didn't think that there would be more articles on van Gogh paintings?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 3:\nText: On another note, I'm going to assume that you were the one who also added ridership data for various LIRR stations, am I correct? If so, could you kindly point me towards your source?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi, you recently speedily deleted this image and in your explanation stated that I, the uploader, was informed of this. I was not - please could you tell me why not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 5:\nText: Hi, although I agree with you, please check the following <url> in process. Why can't the darn thing work, in the first place?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 6:\nText: I was wondering where you got your information for the dice statistics you recently added/changed in <url>.  Can you add a source to those tables?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 7:\nText: Heh, thanks. Do you know of any scripts that might come in handy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 8:\nText: Terms like \"elected\", \"responsible\" and \"designated points-of-contact\" imply some sort of delegated authority, I'd have thought.  By omission, is Hornoir saying that the delegate has authority over other aspects of the project?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 9:\nText: I was just looking again at the April Fool's pranks from this year and came upon <url> to a page you deleted per \"housecleaning\".  Can we undelete and move it somewhere (the latter only if necessary), tagging with <url> in the process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: About your last edit to <url>.  Do you have a source?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: He keeps coming back, and keeps getting blocked again.... When will they learn?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hello Jeffq, I noticed you revert vandalism occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account <url> to help you revert vandalism more easily?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 13:\nText: Nice to see you editing in article space! We have been chipping away at your compiled OBI list - can you believe it's almost done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 14:\nText: Is 10 months sufficient time to relist a AFD?  Not too soon, correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thanks. Now, if I had to make an infobox on \"London\" (just ''London'', I know there are many terms: Greater London, City of London etc), would it be correct to include the area/population/density of the territories I mentioned + the city area, or would just the city area suffice?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 16:\nText: I am planning on changing the <url> to the ICF Flatwater World Championships. Any objections?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 17:\nText: I wonder, did anyone add new links leading to the portal?  Is there an easy way to check this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: It does not appear to have attracted any participants other than Gerda. Perhaps adding a <person> template would draw in more participants?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 19:\nText: Excuse me? What are you accusing me of doing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 20:\nText: Can you help patroling <url> page???\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 21:\nText: I took a quick look and I'm not up to reading through it properly at the moment. :) I'll be back on here tomorrow morning and I'll have a look then, if that's OK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 22:\nText: <url> needs urdu script for the name of the subject (Bangla script has already been added). Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 23:\nText: News coverage would be spotty at best... you would have to go through the stats pages and do it by hand pretty much, so any of the Calgary/Edmonton Sun, Herald or Journal would suffice.  Maybe just send the AJHL an email and ask them?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 24:\nText: Also, all in all, I think Batman should be changed to <url>, not <url>, as the latter refers to those with superhuman powers or abilities, which he lacks. Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sure, but what's the deal with fair use and cropping?  I thought the Zatanna one got removed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 26:\nText: Like most users with their articles screwed over by <url>'s new web facelift, I'm at a lost with <url> being dead. Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 27:\nText: Have a look at the edit to <url>. Is this page even a dab?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 28:\nText: Hi Asbestos! This is kind of weird for me but I see that you are a participant in the photo project and list yourself as a photographer in Edinburgh and I was wondering if there was any possibility that you would be willing to respond to my recent request <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22\n\nExample 29:\nText: The review has been up there for something like six weeks, I notice. Think you'll be able to take care of those last couple of things?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 30:\nText: Converting <url> to a redirect without preserving either the information or sources, & without discussion was ill-advised. A bit more care in future?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nEstimated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: |style=\"vertical-align: middle; padding: 3px;\" | I've started the Badfinger wiki amd I need help.  You seem to know a lot about them, could you please help out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: I seeu2014yes, those can easily be changed back. Would you rather I start a fresh discussion about these?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 3:\nText: Please explain how that is a personal attack? You do realise that someone critisizing your actions is not the same as a personal attack don't you?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 4:\nText: Why nominate this for deletion? It was obviously created by someone who didn't know how to use redirects, so would it not be best to just correct it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: I kind of agree.  Are you planning on actually editing Wikipedia, or is your whole purpose here to promote this ... study (or whatever it is)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4\n\nExample 6:\nText: Are you saying that Scotty was being \"hot-headed\"?  If so, can you please tell us what Scotty did that was \"hot-headed\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 7:\nText: Stephen's solution certainly isn't optimal. Fancy giving me a basic rundown on the problem here and I'll see if I can devise a more elegant one?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 8:\nText: Oh, I see that you removed the redirect from District of Columbia and restored the text.  That has redirected to \"Washington DC\" for about 4 years now, and I've reverted it - if you have something ambitious in mind, please bring it up on one of the talk pages first, okay?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 9:\nText: Thanks, can we write an article on that ? do you think it is notable enough ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used \"on\".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 11:\nText: Then maybe admins should focus on copyright infringements and avoid the leader/educator/cop/parliamentarian roles that they cherish so much.  Could 1000 admins handle this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 12:\nText: Thanks.  Is Brazil4Linux doing anything particully bad right now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I removed that second paragraph entirely, since the information is covered in the article.  Do you feel that the lead should be larger?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
