What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 2:\nText: That's reason to expand the treatment to other painters, not to blank this one.  And you didn't think that there would be more articles on van Gogh paintings?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 3:\nText: Alistair, you have only undone the autoblock; you haven't unblocked the account yet. Could you do that, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 4:\nText: Actually it was a compliment. Does that count as an 'issue'?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 5:\nText: Could you please explain <url> to me? I don't see how deleting a person's userpage is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 6:\nText: And  what did I do wrong???????????????????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hi.  Why did you blank the redirect at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm sorry, but there is no discussion on the talk page that indicates that there was a debate about renaming, so the keep vote stands, I'm afraid.  There were nine votes to keep, and only one to merge, so I don't understand how a single vote trumps nine others?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 9:\nText: I understand your point about MJ being very close and having competent editors, but do you not think those of us who understand the source problems, etc. that the Reagan page is having should try and explain them to those editors (that is, try to educate them)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 10:\nText: About your last edit to <url>.  Do you have a source?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 11:\nText: Could you please explain to me what the buttons do? How do you \"Not accept\" a change, that's what...you revert it, don't you...?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hello Jeffq, I noticed you revert vandalism occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account <url> to help you revert vandalism more easily?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 13:\nText: that hotcat lockup, was like an edit conflict, so i tried a backup and re-enter.  thanks for the assistance, i'm using the old layout, so would the new view affect my hotcat category edits?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hi, I see you voted \"support\" but in the neutral section. Would you like to move that to the support section?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 15:\nText: I found an autoblock and cleared it.  Can you edit now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 16:\nText: The file above does not meet the <url> so as to be copyrighted or eligible for fair use, as I had stated so on <url> when I first moved it there. What issues should be resolved?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 17:\nText: Upon further thought, maybe I could look through lists of deleted articles to see if any interest me and see if I can bring them back (with adequate sourcing). Do you know anything about that process?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 18:\nText: It does not appear to have attracted any participants other than Gerda.

What are you accusing me of doing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 20:\nText: Here's the FFD page: <url>. How do you know that the photograph was made pursuant to a law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 21:\nText: That \"guest\" could have been an undercover Colbert staff member and the whole segment could have been staged. Otherwise, why would Colbert have taken 3 minutes out of his show to talk to someone in the audience?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 22:\nText: <url> needs urdu script for the name of the subject (Bangla script has already been added). Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 23:\nText: Hello. Since you have contributed to <url> in the past, could you spare a minute to discuss the fate of <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: Many people have mentioned this mythical facillity - I've never found it, and assumed it was only available to sysops, which I am not. Is this the case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 25:\nText: Sure, but what's the deal with fair use and cropping?  I thought the Zatanna one got removed?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 26:\nText: Like most users with their articles screwed over by <url>'s new web facelift, I'm at a lost with <url> being dead. Can you help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 27:\nText: Question: how do we move the content from the existing page to the new page?  How do we reference the space to the new page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: I can't find a notice on the source website saying that this image is under a creavtive commons lisence.

What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 3:\nText: I have a quick question for you (I'm asking now since I am sure that this is going to be brought up either at the ACR or the FAC, when I finally get there): you've added a \"pp.\" for the citation given for the national defense authorization act of 2007, but the rest of the article makes use of the \"p.\" system. Shouldn't the \"pp.\" be changed to a \"p.\" for conformity, or is the use of the \"pp.\" correct from the perspective of citation guidelines?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 4:\nText: All my edits to clear Lloyd George disappeared from the running count. They haven't been undone, is this a bug?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 5:\nText: 4. I had once felt that the Euroleague, Italian and Greek leagues were the top leagues.

Are you aware of any country that got special praise for the selection of images in the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 9:\nText: I think this is a clear case of <url> . What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 10:\nText: I think I'm gonna request a free image from a Wikipedia biography subject by following <url>. I was wondering, if I'm planning to upload the image to Commons and the subject doesn't speak English to understand the e-mail, what should I do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 11:\nText: What?!  Why did you resolve this without dealing with the User I mentioned?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hi, noticed you removed categories on defunct/renamed schools. Why do you think them unnecessary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nTarget Example:\nText: See email first. Is this coming from somewhere or something particular?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
