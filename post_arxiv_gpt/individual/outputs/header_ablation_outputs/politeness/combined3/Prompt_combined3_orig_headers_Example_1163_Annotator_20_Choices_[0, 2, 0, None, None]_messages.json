In the process, have I missed anything out?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 3:\nText: you need a copy, you say... by that you mean a translation, or one which has been reconstructed to meet en. wiki coding?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 4:\nText: Again, what would be the point of redirection? Who on earth is going to fall on the redirect first?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 5:\nText: Could you please explain <url> to me? I don't see how deleting a person's userpage is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 6:\nText: And  what did I do wrong???????????????????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 5\n\nExample 7:\nText: Heh, thanks. Do you know of any scripts that might come in handy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 8:\nText: Your <url> is a brilliant idea! Would you mind if I linked to it from my collection of \"Useful things\" on my user page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 9:\nText: Agreed. Why do we even waste our time discussing afd's, if consensus has no bearing on the result?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 10:\nText: You deleted this, but somehow it still shows up on the parent category's page <url>.  Is this normal and/or can you fix this?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: Technically, Taku is within his rights to change things to conform to an existing standard, but it's not very politic of him to do so; if we decide to change, then it's still more meaningless work to change everything once again. Unfortunately, it's all too common for editors to edit first and talk second, eh?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hello Jeffq, I noticed you revert vandalism occasionally. Would you like me to grant your account <url> to help you revert vandalism more easily?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 13:\nText: Nice to see you editing in article space! We have been chipping away at your compiled OBI list - can you believe it's almost done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nExample 14:\nText: BTW, I'm not certain that Queen Victoria can be described as being the Founder without being somewhat misleading. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thanks, was getting worried there for a moment. Have you though of asking Outriggr for a hand with <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 16:\nText: Yeah, and it will still have been the third to pass the full bit string tests, instead of just the byte tests. :)   What's the significance of 2042?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 17:\nText: It turns out that the Zelda Collection you referred to in <url> didn't include aLttP, reportedly because the GBA remake was still being sold at that time, so that disc included NES and N64 emulation but left out SNES. Do you have another example?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 18:\nText: Do your sources have the dates of birth and death for <url>, which I just created? And, while I'm on the topic, any information regarding his playing career (if applicable)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 19:\nText: The <url> has a request (header \"<url>\") left a few hours ago by someone who has pictures of signs in China but can't read them.  Would you please be willing to help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 20:\nText: Just saw your message on <url>. Shall I carry on the review, or shall I wait for a cue from your side when you're ready to carry on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 21:\nText: To me these two bits of TeX look identical after they're rendered.  Can you explain the advantage of the latter format (since you've made a point of changing from the first to the second form in some articles)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 22:\nText: Unfortunately, I'm still worried this may not be enough to avoid arguments.  <url> says \"A separate rationale must be provided each time the image is used in an article.\"  Should we just copy the tag for every article using the logo?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 23:\nText: <url>. Congrats, or should I say good luck?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 24:\nText: Hi, what I'm trying to establish is a reference for the assertion that Swails \"may have been the first <url> commissioned as a officer in the <url> during the <url>\". Does your source say that specifically?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 25:\nText: LOL, I can't believe you reverted Kizzle's deletion of my summary at S & aQ. Did you actually like my summary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 26:\nText: So you're interested in both Amiga computers and BDSM! Are you an atheist too?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 27:\nText: Have a look at the edit to <url>. Is this page even a dab?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 28:\nText: I am not sure what are rules about GA in en.wiki but for me <url> is really outdated and it shouldn`t have GA sign. What you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 29:\nText: Never mind, got it. Is the stereochemistry known?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 30:\nText: Checkuser shows the three users share an ip from time to time. How serious is the problem?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nEstimated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: You have given your point by point rebuttals to my reasons several times. How can you say I haven't provided my reasoning?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 2:\nText: Hi, Matt. Aren't you supposed to be banned?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 3:\nText: Excellent, thank you! Can you also delete the <url> from en and move hooks from the <url> to <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 4:\nText: Nijdam, you quite rightly say, 'Every event that has occurred is a condition'. But many events have occurred, a door has been opened, a goat has been revealed, the host has spoken several words, how do you decide which of these events to condition on?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 5:\nText: The link you provided to speedy delection criteria only goes up to CSD12, and there is no CSD 13 listed there.  Could you clarify?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 6:\nText: Is there any consensus for these changes? If I've missed the discussion, I do apologise, but could you post me a link to where it occurred?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 7:\nText: I don't recall. Is there something there that could damage my computer?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 8:\nText: Be that as it may, and not to quibble with your block, but I did some research and I've found that this puppeteer does in fact exist - the Washington Post described him as a \"master\", for instance, and Woodcarver Online calls him a \"leading puppet artist\". May I ask why you decided that the creation of the article was indicative of socklike behavior?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: This was supposed to have been moved to <url> per the CFD. Why wasn't it moved?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 10:\nText: One more thing, you have a fellow Budgie insisting a losing appearance in an FA Cup semi is an \"Honour\" for your club.  I guess it's because you haven't won much lately, but really, a losing semi-finalist isn't an honour in the real sense of the word, is it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 11:\nText: It's larger now than the sub-stub previously deleted.  Can sources be added to verify the achievements?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 12:\nText: I made the revert as an editor, not an Administrator - I haven't used my Admin tools and I have said I would not use them as I'm involved. Where did I say I hadn't read any of the material?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nTarget Example:\nText: I agreed from my very first post on the first subject that it shouldn't be included yet you and the other user continued to misrepresent my position. Would you disagree with that?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
