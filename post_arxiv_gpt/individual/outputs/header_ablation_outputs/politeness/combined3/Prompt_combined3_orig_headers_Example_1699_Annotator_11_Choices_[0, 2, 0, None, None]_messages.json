Should Wikipedia have a dedicated sunrise article that does not feature even one single decent image of a red sky?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9\n\nExample 2:\nText: That's reason to expand the treatment to other painters, not to blank this one.  And you didn't think that there would be more articles on van Gogh paintings?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 3:\nText: Alistair, you have only undone the autoblock; you haven't unblocked the account yet. Could you do that, please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 4:\nText: Actually it was a compliment. Does that count as an 'issue'?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: Could you please explain <url> to me? I don't see how deleting a person's userpage is correct?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14\n\nExample 6:\nText: And  what did I do wrong???????????????????????\nAnnotation from annotator: 7\n\nExample 7:\nText: Hi.  Why did you blank the redirect at <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: Another proposal: since this about the EP why don't we just mention those that have more than 3 MEPs? VB & LN?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: I understand your point about MJ being very close and having competent editors, but do you not think those of us who understand the source problems, etc. that the Reagan page is having should try and explain them to those editors (that is, try to educate them)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 10:\nText: That's basically what our members have said, not necessarily my opinion. Anything I miss?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 11:\nText: Could you please explain to me what the buttons do? How do you \"Not accept\" a change, that's what...you revert it, don't you...?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 12:\nText: Hi Dirk. Does the two books you cited for the heavy Belgian <url> losses have any info of how many Gladiators the Belgians lost, and perhaps what losses they incurred on the Germans?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 13:\nText: On the third reading... Why not include an edit summary that tells me this? Why not revert my revert?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12\n\nExample 14:\nText: Hi, I see you voted \"support\" but in the neutral section. Would you like to move that to the support section?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 15:\nText: Thanks. Now, if I had to make an infobox on \"London\" (just ''London'', I know there are many terms: Greater London, City of London etc), would it be correct to include the area/population/density of the territories I mentioned + the city area, or would just the city area suffice?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 16:\nText: The file above does not meet the <url> so as to be copyrighted or eligible for fair use, as I had stated so on <url> when I first moved it there. What issues should be resolved?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13\n\nExample 17:\nText: Did you mean to also remove the Breitbart reference from the \"Incidents\" section?  Have I missed a meeting?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 18:\nText: It does not appear to have attracted any participants other than Gerda. Perhaps adding a <person> template would draw in more participants?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 19:\nText: The <url> has a request (header \"<url>\") left a few hours ago by someone who has pictures of signs in China but can't read them.  Would you please be willing to help?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 20:\nText: Here's the FFD page: <url>. How do you know that the photograph was made pursuant to a law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 21:\nText: I took a quick look and I'm not up to reading through it properly at the moment. :) I'll be back on here tomorrow morning and I'll have a look then, if that's OK?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17\n\nExample 22:\nText: Unfortunately, I'm still worried this may not be enough to avoid arguments.  <url> says \"A separate rationale must be provided each time the image is used in an article.\"  Should we just copy the tag for every article using the logo?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 23:\nText: Hello. Since you have contributed to <url> in the past, could you spare a minute to discuss the fate of <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 24:\nText: Also, all in all, I think Batman should be changed to <url>, not <url>, as the latter refers to those with superhuman powers or abilities, which he lacks. Thoughts?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 25:\nText: LOL, I can't believe you reverted Kizzle's deletion of my summary at S & aQ. Did you actually like my summary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 26:\nText: Thank you for removing the \"Speedy Deletion\" from my post. I realise that I still need to do more work on the post itself, but are the sources that I am using acceptable?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 27:\nText: I've never seen something go beyond AN/I myself, and I find it hard to believe the other two hadn't been tried by now. Or is it a case-by-case thing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 28:\nText: Hi Asbestos! This is kind of weird for me but I see that you are a participant in the photo project and list yourself as a photographer in Edinburgh and I was wondering if there was any possibility that you would be willing to respond to my recent request <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 23\n\nExample 29:\nText: The review has been up there for something like six weeks, I notice. Think you'll be able to take care of those last couple of things?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10\n\nExample 30:\nText: Done. I may have missed a few links when copying them across, so could you please look through it just in case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21\n\nEstimated Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I'm also having to use your link.  Perhaps we should change the main page link to use the megaupload until we know that the main website is up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 2:\nText: Hi, yes I love your stats tool too. But could it also cover wikiversity and perhaps the other sister projects?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18\n\nExample 3:\nText: Well...  pretty much most of what was in the old table, and the category links.  May I get in touch with you via e-mail to work on the specifics?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20\n\nExample 4:\nText: Don't worry, I'm not going to give the new right out to people who'll abuse it. :) Where's the new policy page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19\n\nExample 5:\nText: Having said that, I don't want to drive anyone away just because they can't write well. The question is, where do you begin?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11\n\nExample 6:\nText: Hmmm, you are basically asking me to think positively despite evidence and knowing that over this issue none good faith on part of some users was showed in past, but ok, letxb4s see how it goes. The question then is: do you consider including the discussions with outside mediation participants that happend on those talk-pages (direktor, for exemple, has been very active and enthusiastic there lately) or only the in-mediation discussions are the ones that count?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8\n\nExample 7:\nText: MONGO, today you speedied this article as a non notable character.  Surely you know the non notable speedy criteria is for real people, not characters?\nAnnotation from annotator: 6\n\nExample 8:\nText: The article doesn't seem to imply that ''The Game Keeper'' was created by WotC, nor does it give a hint when the company bought the stores.

Is that what you wanted?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: That sounds fine.

You?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15\n\nTarget Example:\nText: Katy, good buddy.  Is <url> your lost article?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
