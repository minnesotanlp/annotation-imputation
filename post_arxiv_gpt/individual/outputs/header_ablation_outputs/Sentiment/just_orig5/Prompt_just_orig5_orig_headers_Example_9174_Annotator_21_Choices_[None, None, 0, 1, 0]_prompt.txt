In this dataset, people are asked to rate the sentiment of text. The possible ratings are as follows: Very negative (-2), somewhat negative (-1), neutral (0), somewhat positive (1), very positive (2).

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: My lower back was aching all through the night  I have to fix my posture! This also reminded me of how old I'm getting *sigh*
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer corresponding to the label.
