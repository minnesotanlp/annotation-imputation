In this dataset, people are asked to rate the sentiment of text. The possible ratings are as follows: Very negative (-2), somewhat negative (-1), neutral (0), somewhat positive (1), very positive (2).

Now you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:
Target Example:
Text: I got contact today. It took fixed my night vision and depth perception problem. But, now I need reading glasses. Ugh! Getting old sucks
Annotation from annotator:
Your output should be a single integer corresponding to the label.
