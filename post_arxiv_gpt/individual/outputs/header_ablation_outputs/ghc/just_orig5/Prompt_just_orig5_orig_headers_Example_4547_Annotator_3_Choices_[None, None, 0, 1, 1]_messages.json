Your output should be an integer label:\nTarget Example:\nText: Well... at least a \u201cman\u201d was still first. By the time all of this makes it to Globalist textbooks in the future it will be a female astronaut who went to the moon just to abort her baby there because she wanted to do it first... before using her size A bra to sling the spacecraft back.\nAnnotation from annotator:\nYour output should be a single integer and nothing else."
