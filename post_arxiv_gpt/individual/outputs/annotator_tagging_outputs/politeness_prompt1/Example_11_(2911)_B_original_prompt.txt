How do you find out the Alexa traffic rank of something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Can you take a look at the article <url> and the conversation going on at <url> (that should probably be moved to the article talk page).  Your thoughts on the most recent commentary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hi there, I always thought <url> was originally AE&CI, not AE&I.  Do you have a reference for AE&I?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: <url> reminded me of a report I want to file about Asad. May I?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I'm in Outer Mongolia from the 27th till the 10th, UB, Hovsgol, UB. Maybe we can meet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Huaiwei,  there is this guy HkCaGu who insist that we shouldnt put Tianjin as one of Xiamen Airline's destination from Singapore just because it passes by Xiamen(MF's HUB) however, this is a direct flight from singapore to tianjin via xiamen. what are your views?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: I have listened to the beginning for your recording of Thomas Jefferson and nothing is mentioned that Thomas Jefferson owned slaves or Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: #I am still convinced the long page on \"prostatitis\" (a misnomer in the case of CPPS) is confusing, with too many sections and subsections, and would benefit from restructuring and the creation of separate pages for each area, or at the very least the removal of the CPPS section to its own, in depth page. You were the only editor to object to this going ahead, with this comment: \"So, suggest keep this on hold for now, but in principle one might similarly split off other classification categories with this then just umbrella simple introduction.\" Do you still hold this view?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Respectfully, you've replied to the message below mine a day ago now. Could you provide guidance for my request please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I would advise against creating seperate articles for individual characters and stick to the list. Is this what you'd expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: I don't want to be your enemy. What can I do to help this situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow might annotator B label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: The file in question was sourced from the official website of Bobby Schilling, bobby2010.com. Does this resolve the issue?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
