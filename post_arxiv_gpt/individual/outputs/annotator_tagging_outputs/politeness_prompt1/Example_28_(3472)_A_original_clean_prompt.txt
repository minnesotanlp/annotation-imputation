Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Just noticed that the "time" field is eliminated from the collapsable boxes. Could you make this something that is displayed when the box is expanded?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 2:
Text: Call me a little dense.  Do you mean there has to be the same number of Songs, articles, albums, and bio's on the portal for the portal to work?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 3:
Text: Actually, the page I am looking for is more like the equivalent of '''<url>''' here at en:wiki.  Do you know of such a page at nn:wiki?
Annotation from annotator: 14.0

Example 4:
Text: Secondly, please show me where Maynard Smith credits this idea to Haldane.  Have you read the Grafen paper?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was "Left-libertarianism in political philosophy".  If it were changed back to something like that and moved to the top, would that be satisfactory?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 2:
Text: So argument that "''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 3:
Text: So, I'm a "deletion fanatic"? Why don't you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people?
Annotation from annotator: 3.0

Example 4:
Text: I've been "busy" (all day today in Death Valley admiring the spring bloom), and I would like to get at least partial buyin from HG if possible. Not a big hurry to rename, right?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

How annotator C has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Greetings, the Province of Alberta, through legislation, has designated a future highway that has an alignment and an assigned number, but has yet to be constructed. Is it premature to create an article on such a highway?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 2:
Text: The article <url> is vandalism. Could you please delete it?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 3:
Text: The text of your warning <url> made me smile. Did you really think that if China got a new Prime Minister as of today, and a female one at that, it wouldn't be all over the news, and the link to this person would be red?
Annotation from annotator: 4.0

Example 4:
Text: Can you give me a link to "We Are Defiance" ? And what do you mean by "remove" : 1) moving to the main space or 2) deleting the article ?
Annotation from annotator: 8.0

How might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
Text: Hi, we worked on a few Australian-related articles together. May be you want to make a look on my <url>?
