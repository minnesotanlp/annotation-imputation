Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Go to <url> and create it like you would a page: just add a little text by putting in a little explanation at the top and adding categories u2014 see <url> for a basic category of this sort, although on a very different subject.  Let me ask, however: are you planning to categorise articles about schools and/or districts, or articles on the cities where they are based?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used \"on\".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: If the only page you've been visiting is Wikipedia, then it makes sense the viruses would come from here, but if you've been to other sites, they get thrown into the equation. Again, don't you have any anti-virus software?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Jtdirl: Seek primary source mentioning 1845 lightweight tiara made for Gregory XVI. Do you have it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I had a quick scan through the <url> article, which while good seems to be to suffer from the negative effects of \"summary style\" when used on very large topics - namely that while the individual sections are good summaries of what they are describing, the ''overall'' article lacks a coherent flow, a narrative taking the reader from beginning to end. Does that make sense?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: No problem, It was open and shut <url> issue. For your next project can you find something that doesnt make your fanclub at the Wikipedia Review angry?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hey, if you took this picture you can release it into the public domain. If not, do you know who took it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Thanks! By the way, have you sent anything to Maggie since you received the email from the photographer?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Fair nuff. Anyhow, somebody's birthday is coming up, is it not?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: You wrote \"speedy keep\" for Patrick Bouvier Kennedy.  Should you do it again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: There's a question about where you got the image of the ''Enterprise''.  Maybe you could clarify?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17.0\n\nHow might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: I know, I looked it up and fixed the article, but it was annoying that you just changed one small thing making the page contradict itself. What's the use changing it if the reader will have no idea what's going on?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
