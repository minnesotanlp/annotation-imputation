Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: What a joke, this player has played league football all his career and some clown has now deleted it off, what kind of rules has this been deleted under then? "May be deleted" seems a bit of a poor excuse to me personally, fancy giving me some information as to why this has been deleted then guys?
Annotation from annotator: 8.0

Example 2:
Text: I would advise against creating seperate articles for individual characters and stick to the list. Is this what you'd expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 3:
Text: Hi I noticed you speedied and article but not it's talk page? What's the use of leaving the talk page, discussion or no, if you're going to speedy the article?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 4:
Text: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Per <url>, there was an autoblock affecting your editing that has now been lifted.  Can you edit freely now?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 2:
Text: Thats good. Do you have any enemies on here as well?
Annotation from annotator: 0.0

Example 3:
Text: I give a glimpse there now and then. What is up?
Annotation from annotator: 8.0

Example 4:
Text: Hello im trying to make a task force for the Empire of Brazil with some people but we dont know how to make the actually task force stuff like the banner and how to make the quality chart template to see what class each article is. Im asking if you can help make it since i saw you made WikiProject Dam?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

How annotator C has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: I am stuck with the formatting of <url>, especially the ref tags. How can I make the different chapters of my main source book show up correctly?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 2:
Text: <url> is up for deletion. Can you find some sources in Belarusian?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 3:
Text: Hello...I looked up <url>, and found that this person is a previous vandal. Is this sufficient to block the user, since more vandalism was done on Cold War article?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 4:
Text: I have the picture (3D) model of a chemical compound made with Accelrys, but I don't have Photoshop. What can I do?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How might annotator C label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
