Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Well, I'd have to disagree with you about adding animators. If I'm not mistaken, manga artists and comic book editors both participate in the writing of the books, so I could see their inclusion, but don't animators just do the artwork?
Annotation from annotator: 14.0

Example 2:
Text: May I say it this way: ''Even if the car always is known to be behind the same door,'' but if you make your decision "at random", ''even then'' your chance is 2/3 to have picked a goat. Okay?
Annotation from annotator: 9.0

Example 3:
Text: Well, actually I wanted to know if there were any errors in my own maps. ;)  Anyway, is the new map at <url> better?
Annotation from annotator: 15.0

Example 4:
Text: It seems you have been investigating this administrator and have brought up several incidents in your evidence based on that. If possible, could you please link to the feedback that Dreadstar has received as an administrator during/after each of those incidents (and if there was no feedback to any of those incidents, could you please let me know in reply to this)?
Annotation from annotator: 14.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: There hasn't been much progress made in the last three days. Is anyone interested in responding?
Annotation from annotator: 21.0

Example 2:
Text: Note however that <url> does not exist. Which page were you talking about in this case?
Annotation from annotator: 17.0

Example 3:
Text: Your "resolution" was to move it back to "Detective Terry Crowley" again? Why do you keep doing that?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 4:
Text: You recently attached a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag to an article about an Azeri poet. May I ask why?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

How annotator C has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Another proposal: since this about the EP why don't we just mention those that have more than 3 MEPs? VB & LN?
Annotation from annotator: 8.0

Example 2:
Text: It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided.  Do you have any references you can add to the article?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 3:
Text: Thanks for your support. Could you check and give me your opinion on the debate at <url> and, in case you agree with me, ask Critzu to explain himself?
Annotation from annotator: 0.0

Example 4:
Text: And "...definitions...".  What do you mean by "...definitions..."?
Annotation from annotator: 4.0

How might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
Text: You're welcome to revert edits, but I'm puzzled as to why you reverted this one - it seems absolutely essential to me the give a summary of Genesis 1. And if you revert Gen1, why leave Gen2?
