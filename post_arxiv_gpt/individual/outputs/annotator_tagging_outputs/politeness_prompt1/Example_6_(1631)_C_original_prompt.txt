Is this what you'd expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hi I noticed you speedied and article but not it's talk page? What's the use of leaving the talk page, discussion or no, if you're going to speedy the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Per <url>, there was an autoblock affecting your editing that has now been lifted.  Can you edit freely now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Thats good. Do you have any enemies on here as well?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: I give a glimpse there now and then. What is up?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hello im trying to make a task force for the Empire of Brazil with some people but we dont know how to make the actually task force stuff like the banner and how to make the quality chart template to see what class each article is. Im asking if you can help make it since i saw you made WikiProject Dam?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I am stuck with the formatting of <url>, especially the ref tags. How can I make the different chapters of my main source book show up correctly?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: <url> is up for deletion. Can you find some sources in Belarusian?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hello...I looked up <url>, and found that this person is a previous vandal. Is this sufficient to block the user, since more vandalism was done on Cold War article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I have the picture (3D) model of a chemical compound made with Accelrys, but I don't have Photoshop. What can I do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow might annotator C label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: Thanks for your edits to the LEMS article a couple of days back. Any hope of you reviewing it for GAC?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
