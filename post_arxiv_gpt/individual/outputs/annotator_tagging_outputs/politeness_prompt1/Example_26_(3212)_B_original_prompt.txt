Let's see... what does Liebman have in common with the type of pain you might get from a cactus needle?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Very strange, how come I can see all the other posts? How do I clear the cache - do you know?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I added mention of the river. The info for <url> says the picture was taken in <url>; is that city located on the river?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: That looks better. I think I'm about done now, but old Theobald's still at FAC isn't he?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I notice you are still contributing to Wikipedia, but have not responded to my argument.

Could you provide guidance for my request please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I would advise against creating seperate articles for individual characters and stick to the list.

What can I do to help this situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow might annotator B label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: The Gestalt Prayer (and it's modified version missing the last line, as the article explained) is of cultural and historical importance.
