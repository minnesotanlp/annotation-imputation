Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Go to <url> and create it like you would a page: just add a little text by putting in a little explanation at the top and adding categories u2014 see <url> for a basic category of this sort, although on a very different subject.  Let me ask, however: are you planning to categorise articles about schools and/or districts, or articles on the cities where they are based?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used \"on\".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: If the only page you've been visiting is Wikipedia, then it makes sense the viruses would come from here, but if you've been to other sites, they get thrown into the equation. Again, don't you have any anti-virus software?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Hi Zaps, I've noticed that you edited the abovementioned article.

How does that look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Many thanks for the review. So what was the truce term ''you'' used when little then?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I saw you assess this with a B. What am I missing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 7.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I thought that it seemed a bit removed from Imlay's own time and there was no real explanation of the significance of Imlay to Twain (if any) or of Imlay's reputation between her death and the end of the nineteenth century or in America. What do you think?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: As another aside, they are mostly Germans.  What's up with that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi, Michael David. Was there any consensus reached on this issue?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: I'm pretty sure there already is a filter (possibly more than one) for this. What page got moved?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
