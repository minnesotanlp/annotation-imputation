Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Hi, I noticed on <url> you mentioned its Alexa traffic rank.  How do you find out the Alexa traffic rank of something?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 2:
Text: Can you take a look at the article <url> and the conversation going on at <url> (that should probably be moved to the article talk page).  Your thoughts on the most recent commentary?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 3:
Text: Hi there, I always thought <url> was originally AE&CI, not AE&I.  Do you have a reference for AE&I?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 4:
Text: <url> reminded me of a report I want to file about Asad. May I?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Ack, hit the wrong button?  How do you manage that?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 2:
Text: Thanks--can you add the romanization of the Arabic at <url> too? Is it ''jibna baladi''?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 3:
Text: Rod, this guy's ( <url>) talk page as well as the history of vandalism to the <url> page seems to indicate that he's the main perpetrator. Is there some way to ban one particular user from editing a page, based on repeat incidents of vandalism to that page?
Annotation from annotator: 14.0

Example 4:
Text: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?
Annotation from annotator: 10.0

How annotator C has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Respectfully, you've replied to the message below mine a day ago now. Could you provide guidance for my request please?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 2:
Text: I would advise against creating seperate articles for individual characters and stick to the list. Is this what you'd expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 3:
Text: I don't want to be your enemy. What can I do to help this situation?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 4:
Text: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
Text: Hi Mic, you changed <url> with a comment of "Conforming to header format". Where can I get the standard header format ?
