Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Just noticed that the "time" field is eliminated from the collapsable boxes. Could you make this something that is displayed when the box is expanded?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 2:
Text: Call me a little dense.  Do you mean there has to be the same number of Songs, articles, albums, and bio's on the portal for the portal to work?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 3:
Text: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used "on".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 4:
Text: Secondly, please show me where Maynard Smith credits this idea to Haldane.  Have you read the Grafen paper?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: <url> is basically ready for FAC pending some copy edits. Could you take a look to see if anything additional needs to be done?
Annotation from annotator: 18.0

Example 2:
Text: I have also put speedy delete tags on <url> and <url>.  Was there any particular reason to move your user/user talk pages to that name, and back again?
Annotation from annotator: 8.0

Example 3:
Text: Transport not geeky if an area is unserviced. Are nights and w/ends?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 4:
Text: Then I think that we need to be a little poetic, rather than the rather prosaic "qualities associated with his weapons". What about something like "the magical properties attributed to his weapons"?
Annotation from annotator: 9.0

How annotator C has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Excellent, thanks! I wonder if it's worth temporarily uploading a cropped image for the main page, as 100x100 is really very small?
Annotation from annotator: 22.0

Example 2:
Text: Your recent post to the straw poll at <url> may need some clarification. Did you intend "support going to Arbcomm" to be a vote for the "Death" entry?
Annotation from annotator: 18.0

Example 3:
Text: What would the recommended sequencing be, then?... GAR, then FAR?
Annotation from annotator: 19.0

Example 4:
Text: I've read everything again, and I still think it's the right decision. What I'm confused about is if you claim that <url> does not care about capitalisation, how do you explain <url>, <url> and <url> (examples given on the talk page)?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
Text: Is your username Davshul? When would you be online?
