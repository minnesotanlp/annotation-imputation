Why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Go to <url> and create it like you would a page: just add a little text by putting in a little explanation at the top and adding categories u2014 see <url> for a basic category of this sort, although on a very different subject.  Let me ask, however: are you planning to categorise articles about schools and/or districts, or articles on the cities where they are based?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used \"on\".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: If the only page you've been visiting is Wikipedia, then it makes sense the viruses would come from here, but if you've been to other sites, they get thrown into the equation. Again, don't you have any anti-virus software?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Yes, or you could change what it looks like. What do you want to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: He's stumped about what the block is for, and so am I. Could you clarify?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Oosterman is hardly the world's foremost expert on Hyper-Calvinism.  Can you cite any scholars or experts who support your thesis?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: You shouldn't have to put up with abuse on your talk page, I don't understand why they weren't blocked. Did you take it to ANI?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Greetings, the Province of Alberta, through legislation, has designated a future highway that has an alignment and an assigned number, but has yet to be constructed. Is it premature to create an article on such a highway?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: The article <url> is vandalism. Could you please delete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: The text of your warning <url> made me smile. Did you really think that if China got a new Prime Minister as of today, and a female one at that, it wouldn't be all over the news, and the link to this person would be red?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Can you give me a link to \"We Are Defiance\" ? And what do you mean by \"remove\" : 1) moving to the main space or 2) deleting the article ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nHow might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: Thanks; it just occurred to me to cite USGS maps, but this is maybe even better.  Was there once an airplane crash in the vicinity, or are there maps like this for all parts of the country?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
