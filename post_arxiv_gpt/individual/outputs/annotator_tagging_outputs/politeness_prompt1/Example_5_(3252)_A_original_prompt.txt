How many Canadian articles are even at that status?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: King Kong is a notable legacy of Beauty and the Beast.  What should an article do besides say what the subject is notable for, explain the subject's legacy?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Jenny and Silas info should surface within the week, Daily Mail will have some reception for him and her. \"India's murder\" and \"Fued with Lynsey Nolan\" maybe?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I believe supserstition exists.  Why did you ask me?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was \"Left-libertarianism in political philosophy\".

In the future, can you kindly post a note on your userpage, talkpage, or somewhere else so I know that the bot isn't broken?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: You have given your point by point rebuttals to my reasons several times. How can you say I haven't provided my reasoning?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Well, is there any kind of deadline? I guess I had to hurry?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nHow might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: I haven't heard from you in sometime. Como estan las cosas?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
