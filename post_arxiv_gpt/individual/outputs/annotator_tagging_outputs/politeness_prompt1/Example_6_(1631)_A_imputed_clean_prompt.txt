Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: I haven't uploaded any more to Wiki because they tend to be more detailed and rather more abstruse. Have you had a look at Barry Burnham's book from Oxbow of 2004?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 2:
Text: I noticed you put "NB" and then the credit for the original picture that I cropped. What does "NB" stand for?
Annotation from annotator: 14.0

Example 3:
Text: Need help with EF 175 via email. Mind <url> so we can discuss?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 4:
Text: The template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like 'This article is a copy of the (X) article in the German wikipedia, version 21 December 2009 10:04.' What is that template?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0
