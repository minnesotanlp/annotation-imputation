Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: If Doxiedana comes back to Wikipedia and asks me to restore her userpage, I will consider it. Are you claiming Doxiedana as your alternate account?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 2:
Text: Hello. Regarding <url>, could you tell me what supports this being a free image?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Annotation from annotator: 4.0

Example 4:
Text: -- Bit confused by your DYK nom.  Surely the world's first gasoline automobile was created by <url> four years earlier?
Annotation from annotator: 8.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:

Annotation from annotator: 4.0
