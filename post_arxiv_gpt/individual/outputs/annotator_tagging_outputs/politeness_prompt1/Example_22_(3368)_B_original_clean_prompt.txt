Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Respectfully, you've replied to the message below mine a day ago now. Could you provide guidance for my request please?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 2:
Text: I would advise against creating seperate articles for individual characters and stick to the list. Is this what you'd expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 3:
Text: I don't want to be your enemy. What can I do to help this situation?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 4:
Text: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: in this case the noun has to be capitalised, so "Erdene Zuu monastery" would be "Erdene Zuu Monastery". And why did you move <url>, what other monastery with this name exists?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 2:
Text: But the block you've used is messing with me accessing WP though my user account; do you know why? Or if it can be fixed, without unblocking?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 3:
Text: Who deleted it? Would I be violating due process if I undeleted it?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 4:
Text: When I wrote <url> I was not quite sure if it was a synonym of <url>, and hence did not perform a merge. Could you clarify if they are indeed the same, and if so whether we should merge the articles?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How annotator C has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Listen, the reason I put those signs in the code 'break-clear' is because the arrangement of the blocks is ''off-key'', at least when looking through IE or Mozilla. Why are you taking them off?
Annotation from annotator: 2.0

Example 2:
Text: Dana, before I give the examples of what sections or parts in the article that needs fixing, I need to know if <url> is still gonna work on the problems. Do you get me?
Annotation from annotator: 4.0

Example 3:
Text: Hello. I was just wondering, is it really fair to delete an unintentional duplication of a deleted category without a formal CFD submission?
Annotation from annotator: 8.0

Example 4:
Text: I see <url> some <person> tags to the <url> page. Is there something in particular you feel needs citation, or did the article just look generally reference-sparse?
Annotation from annotator: 14.0

How might annotator B label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
Text: This redirect isn't working because the admin who locked the page slapped a template onto it, causing this link to become mundane. Can you fix this puzzling circumstance?
