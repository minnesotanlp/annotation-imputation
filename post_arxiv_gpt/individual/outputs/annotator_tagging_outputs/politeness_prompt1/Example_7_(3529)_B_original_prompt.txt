How's stuff?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: A quick question: I've noticed that people (including yourself) have been moving links to other wikis from the top of the article to the bottom. If this a good thing to do, then I can do likewise, but I wondered if there was a rationale / convention here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: That's a good idea. What about army and corps HQs though?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Thanks for your reply. I've tried to incorporate the references into the article; how is it now?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was \"Left-libertarianism in political philosophy\".  If it were changed back to something like that and moved to the top, would that be satisfactory?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: So argument that \"''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''\" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: So, I'm a \"deletion fanatic\"? Why don't you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've been \"busy\" (all day today in Death Valley admiring the spring bloom), and I would like to get at least partial buyin from HG if possible. Not a big hurry to rename, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Thanks for your note, Tom. As a matter of interest, how could you know who someone is based on the IP address?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I restored 3 non-piped blue links.  How does that look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: My bot finally got past the connection errors I've been getting and spit out the largest 4,000 articles in sorted order for this. Would you like to take a short break while I replace the first page with them and manually mark all of the already-checked ones as done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi I noticed you speedied and article but not it's talk page? What's the use of leaving the talk page, discussion or no, if you're going to speedy the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nHow might annotator B label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: Your closing statement in <url> has been cited as a <url> for the above AfD.  Can you make a comment in this discussion?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
