Example 2:
Text: The article <url> is vandalism. Could you please delete it?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 4:
Text: Can you give me a link to "We Are Defiance" ? And what do you mean by "remove" : 1) moving to the main space or 2) deleting the article ?

How might annotator B label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
Text: I was reading the article reverse overshot wheel, but I can't find anything about the "reverse" part. Can you expand this?
