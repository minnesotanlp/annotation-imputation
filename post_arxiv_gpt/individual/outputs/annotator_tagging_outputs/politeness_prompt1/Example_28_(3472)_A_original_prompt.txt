Could you make this something that is displayed when the box is expanded?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Call me a little dense.  Do you mean there has to be the same number of Songs, articles, albums, and bio's on the portal for the portal to work?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Actually, the page I am looking for is more like the equivalent of '''<url>''' here at en:wiki.  Do you know of such a page at nn:wiki?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Secondly, please show me where Maynard Smith credits this idea to Haldane.  Have you read the Grafen paper?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was \"Left-libertarianism in political philosophy\".  If it were changed back to something like that and moved to the top, would that be satisfactory?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: So argument that \"''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''\" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: So, I'm a \"deletion fanatic\"? Why don't you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people?\nAnnotation from annotator: 3.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've been \"busy\" (all day today in Death Valley admiring the spring bloom), and I would like to get at least partial buyin from HG if possible. Not a big hurry to rename, right?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Greetings, the Province of Alberta, through legislation, has designated a future highway that has an alignment and an assigned number, but has yet to be constructed. Is it premature to create an article on such a highway?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: The article <url> is vandalism. Could you please delete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: The text of your warning <url> made me smile. Did you really think that if China got a new Prime Minister as of today, and a female one at that, it wouldn't be all over the news, and the link to this person would be red?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Can you give me a link to \"We Are Defiance\" ? And what do you mean by \"remove\" : 1) moving to the main space or 2) deleting the article ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nHow might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: Hi, we worked on a few Australian-related articles together. May be you want to make a look on my <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
