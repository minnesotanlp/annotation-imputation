How do you find out the Alexa traffic rank of something?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Can you take a look at the article <url> and the conversation going on at <url> (that should probably be moved to the article talk page).  Your thoughts on the most recent commentary?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hi there, I always thought <url> was originally AE&CI, not AE&I.  Do you have a reference for AE&I?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: <url> reminded me of a report I want to file about Asad. May I?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Ack, hit the wrong button?  How do you manage that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Thanks--can you add the romanization of the Arabic at <url> too? Is it ''jibna baladi''?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Rod, this guy's ( <url>) talk page as well as the history of vandalism to the <url> page seems to indicate that he's the main perpetrator. Is there some way to ban one particular user from editing a page, based on repeat incidents of vandalism to that page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Respectfully, you've replied to the message below mine a day ago now. Could you provide guidance for my request please?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I would advise against creating seperate articles for individual characters and stick to the list. Is this what you'd expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: I don't want to be your enemy. What can I do to help this situation?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow might annotator B label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: Hi Mic, you changed <url> with a comment of \"Conforming to header format\". Where can I get the standard header format ?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
