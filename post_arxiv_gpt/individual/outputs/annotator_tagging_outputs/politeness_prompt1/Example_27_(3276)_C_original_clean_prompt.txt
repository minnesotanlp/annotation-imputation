Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 4:
Text: Force vector and displacement vector is a bit wonky and way above my head in mathematical theory but I wonu2019t disagree. Can you link the two to another article?
Annotation from annotator: 14.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:

Annotation from annotator: 17.0

How annotator C has labeled some examples:
Example 1:

Annotation from annotator: 8.0

Text: So why then does the lead stat in Christianity need a reference? Isn't it being contained in the article good enough?
Annotation from annotator: 9.0
