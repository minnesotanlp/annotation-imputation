If I'm not mistaken, manga artists and comic book editors both participate in the writing of the books, so I could see their inclusion, but don't animators just do the artwork?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: May I say it this way: ''Even if the car always is known to be behind the same door,'' but if you make your decision \"at random\", ''even then'' your chance is 2/3 to have picked a goat. Okay?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Well, actually I wanted to know if there were any errors in my own maps. ;)  Anyway, is the new map at <url> better?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: It seems you have been investigating this administrator and have brought up several incidents in your evidence based on that. If possible, could you please link to the feedback that Dreadstar has received as an administrator during/after each of those incidents (and if there was no feedback to any of those incidents, could you please let me know in reply to this)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: There hasn't been much progress made in the last three days. Is anyone interested in responding?\nAnnotation from annotator: 21.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Note however that <url> does not exist. Which page were you talking about in this case?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Your \"resolution\" was to move it back to \"Detective Terry Crowley\" again? Why do you keep doing that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: You recently attached a <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag to an article about an Azeri poet. May I ask why?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Another proposal: since this about the EP why don't we just mention those that have more than 3 MEPs? VB & LN?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: It looks like the current version of <url> has been reworked since when you built it in July 2005 and references have never been provided.  Do you have any references you can add to the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Thanks for your support. Could you check and give me your opinion on the debate at <url> and, in case you agree with me, ask Critzu to explain himself?\nAnnotation from annotator: 0.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: And \"...definitions...\".  What do you mean by \"...definitions...\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nHow might annotator C label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: You're welcome to revert edits, but I'm puzzled as to why you reverted this one - it seems absolutely essential to me the give a summary of Genesis 1. And if you revert Gen1, why leave Gen2?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
