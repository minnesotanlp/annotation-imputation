Perhaps you would prefer to delete the two new biographies that I have just started to cover the red links?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: In <url> you said that Fischer recommended a line in ''My 60 Memorable Games''.  Where is that in the book?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hi.  Not complaining, but why did you remove the category \"high schools in california\" from this article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hey, i saw you added <person> some time ago to the pic page. I'm just curious, why do you want it to still be available here?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: thank you. any clue what happened?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I noticed your \"Original Research\" notation for the section on weights and measures in the article in Liberia. Could you explain in more detail your concern and how it might be remedied?\nAnnotation from annotator: 13.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Need help with EF 175 via email. Mind <url> so we can discuss?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Greetings, sorry to bother you here... I have been using the MissingTopics tool for years, to generate <url> The last time I used it successfully was Nov 16.  Something must have changed in the algorhythms since then, because it will no longer read any page starting with an Amharic character... Is it broke?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: What a joke, this player has played league football all his career and some clown has now deleted it off, what kind of rules has this been deleted under then? \"May be deleted\" seems a bit of a poor excuse to me personally, fancy giving me some information as to why this has been deleted then guys?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I would advise against creating seperate articles for individual characters and stick to the list. Is this what you'd expect a typical encyclopedia to be covering?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Hi I noticed you speedied and article but not it's talk page? What's the use of leaving the talk page, discussion or no, if you're going to speedy the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I see your point, but my real issue was wanting to add the 'too much trivia' tag as all these 'minor aspects' need to be integrated into the relevant sections (I'll have a go myself if I get time). Isn't it possible to create a 'pop culture references' section and then siphon it off into a separate page when it gets too big?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow might annotator B label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: The icon is appearing before the number and after . Can you have a look ?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
