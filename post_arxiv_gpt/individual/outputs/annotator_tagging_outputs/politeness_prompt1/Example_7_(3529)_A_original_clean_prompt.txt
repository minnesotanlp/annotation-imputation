Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Hey, long time no seeing! How's stuff?
Annotation from annotator: 14.0

Example 2:
Text: A quick question: I've noticed that people (including yourself) have been moving links to other wikis from the top of the article to the bottom. If this a good thing to do, then I can do likewise, but I wondered if there was a rationale / convention here?
Annotation from annotator: 19.0

Example 3:
Text: That's a good idea. What about army and corps HQs though?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 4:
Text: Thanks for your reply. I've tried to incorporate the references into the article; how is it now?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: I believe in previous versions of the article, the title of that section was "Left-libertarianism in political philosophy".  If it were changed back to something like that and moved to the top, would that be satisfactory?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 2:
Text: So argument that "''Note: many Moldovans declared themselves as Romanians or Russians.''" is wrong because NO Moldovians declared themselves as russian?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

Example 3:
Text: So, I'm a "deletion fanatic"? Why don't you refrain from uncivil remarks and focus on adding sources to your unsourced stubs - help the encyclopedia rather than pissing off people?
Annotation from annotator: 3.0

Example 4:
Text: I've been "busy" (all day today in Death Valley admiring the spring bloom), and I would like to get at least partial buyin from HG if possible. Not a big hurry to rename, right?
Annotation from annotator: 12.0

How annotator C has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Thanks for your note, Tom. As a matter of interest, how could you know who someone is based on the IP address?
Annotation from annotator: 15.0

Example 2:
Text: I restored 3 non-piped blue links.  How does that look?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 3:
Text: My bot finally got past the connection errors I've been getting and spit out the largest 4,000 articles in sorted order for this. Would you like to take a short break while I replace the first page with them and manually mark all of the already-checked ones as done?
Annotation from annotator: 18.0

Example 4:
Text: Hi I noticed you speedied and article but not it's talk page? What's the use of leaving the talk page, discussion or no, if you're going to speedy the article?
Annotation from annotator: 4.0

How might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
