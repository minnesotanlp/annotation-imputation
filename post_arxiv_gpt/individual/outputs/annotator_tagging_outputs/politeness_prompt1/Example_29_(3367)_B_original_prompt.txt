Could you make this something that is displayed when the box is expanded?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Call me a little dense.  Do you mean there has to be the same number of Songs, articles, albums, and bio's on the portal for the portal to work?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: That's OK &mdash; I just wondered if you had a new translation that used \"on\".  Where are you studying philosophy, by the way?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Secondly, please show me where Maynard Smith credits this idea to Haldane.  Have you read the Grafen paper?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: <url> is basically ready for FAC pending some copy edits. Could you take a look to see if anything additional needs to be done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I have also put speedy delete tags on <url> and <url>.  Was there any particular reason to move your user/user talk pages to that name, and back again?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Transport not geeky if an area is unserviced. Are nights and w/ends?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Then I think that we need to be a little poetic, rather than the rather prosaic \"qualities associated with his weapons\". What about something like \"the magical properties attributed to his weapons\"?\nAnnotation from annotator: 9.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Excellent, thanks! I wonder if it's worth temporarily uploading a cropped image for the main page, as 100x100 is really very small?\nAnnotation from annotator: 22.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Your recent post to the straw poll at <url> may need some clarification. Did you intend \"support going to Arbcomm\" to be a vote for the \"Death\" entry?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: What would the recommended sequencing be, then?... GAR, then FAR?\nAnnotation from annotator: 19.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: I've read everything again, and I still think it's the right decision. What I'm confused about is if you claim that <url> does not care about capitalisation, how do you explain <url>, <url> and <url> (examples given on the talk page)?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow might annotator B label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: Is your username Davshul? When would you be online?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
