Description of the dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked how polite they believe the text to be. 0 means polite, while 25 is impolite.

How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Hardly. Does the <url> exercise executive control over Northern Ireland?
Annotation from annotator: 11.0

Example 2:
Text: That's the British English spelling. American English wins out on a lot of stuff on Wikipedia, so why not give a cookie to the Brits now and then?
Annotation from annotator: 11.0

Example 3:
Text: I will readily grant that. But where was the urgent reason not to follow it in any of the above cases?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 4:
Text: OK. In the future, can you kindly post a note on your userpage, talkpage, or somewhere else so I know that the bot isn't broken?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

How annotator B has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Yes, or you could change what it looks like. What do you want to do?
Annotation from annotator: 17.0

Example 2:
Text: I've made a start to putting the list in chart form at <url>.  Can you think of any other columns to add?
Annotation from annotator: 16.0

Example 3:
Text: Oosterman is hardly the world's foremost expert on Hyper-Calvinism.  Can you cite any scholars or experts who support your thesis?
Annotation from annotator: 4.0

Example 4:
Text: Okay, I read through it (skimmed through some parts as they are largely repetitive). I think maybe a good place to bring this up would be in <url>?
Annotation from annotator: 17.0

How annotator C has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Thanks for your note, Tom. As a matter of interest, how could you know who someone is based on the IP address?
Annotation from annotator: 15.0

Example 2:
Text: I restored 3 non-piped blue links.  How does that look?
Annotation from annotator: 20.0

Example 3:
Text: My bot finally got past the connection errors I've been getting and spit out the largest 4,000 articles in sorted order for this. Would you like to take a short break while I replace the first page with them and manually mark all of the already-checked ones as done?
Annotation from annotator: 18.0

Example 4:
Text: Hi I noticed you speedied and article but not it's talk page? What's the use of leaving the talk page, discussion or no, if you're going to speedy the article?
Annotation from annotator: 4.0

How might annotator C label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
Text: I've come to state that I find it mildly amusing that you don't consider a press release for a journalism award from Columbia University to be a "substantial story from a citable source".  Isn't Columbia among the world's most prestigious journalism schools?
