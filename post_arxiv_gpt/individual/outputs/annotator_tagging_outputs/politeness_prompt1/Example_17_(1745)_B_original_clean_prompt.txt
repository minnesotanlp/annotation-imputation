How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Regarding your SM questions, I honestly don't think a great deal of thought was put into the anime adaptation. As for Viluy, I see a theme with the Witches 5's names and I don't see a reason that Viluy should deviate; maybe the stone is named for the deity?
