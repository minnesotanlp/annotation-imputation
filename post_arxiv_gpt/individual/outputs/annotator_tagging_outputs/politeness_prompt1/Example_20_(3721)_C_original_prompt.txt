Give me an honest opinion Haunted Angel what do you yhink of him?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Don't you think you should remove the welcoming plate of cookies you left at User:Dococe page???\nAnnotation from annotator: 0.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: I suppose that there is nothing to be done about it, but Jamesd1 just buried a direct question to him, about compromise, under a long discussion about Alice Bailey's supposed religious views  (Bailey was not a Christian) that belong on a Bailey discussion forum, not on this article's talk page. Does not Wikipedia have some way to resolve editing situations in which editors refuse to compromise and end the arguing?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Who do you think will be the next president? Do you have a favorite yet?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Ack, hit the wrong button?  How do you manage that?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: Thanks--can you add the romanization of the Arabic at <url> too? Is it ''jibna baladi''?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Rod, this guy's ( <url>) talk page as well as the history of vandalism to the <url> page seems to indicate that he's the main perpetrator. Is there some way to ban one particular user from editing a page, based on repeat incidents of vandalism to that page?\nAnnotation from annotator: 14.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation from annotator: 10.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Greetings, the Province of Alberta, through legislation, has designated a future highway that has an alignment and an assigned number, but has yet to be constructed. Is it premature to create an article on such a highway?\nAnnotation from annotator: 12.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: The article <url> is vandalism. Could you please delete it?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: The text of your warning <url> made me smile. Did you really think that if China got a new Prime Minister as of today, and a female one at that, it wouldn't be all over the news, and the link to this person would be red?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Can you give me a link to \"We Are Defiance\" ? And what do you mean by \"remove\" : 1) moving to the main space or 2) deleting the article ?\nAnnotation from annotator: 8.0\n\nHow might annotator C label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: I was reading the article reverse overshot wheel, but I can't find anything about the \"reverse\" part. Can you expand this?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
