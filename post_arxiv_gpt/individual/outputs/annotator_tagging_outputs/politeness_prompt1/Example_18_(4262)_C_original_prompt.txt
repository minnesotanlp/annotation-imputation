Does the <url> exercise executive control over Northern Ireland?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: That's the British English spelling. American English wins out on a lot of stuff on Wikipedia, so why not give a cookie to the Brits now and then?\nAnnotation from annotator: 11.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: I will readily grant that. But where was the urgent reason not to follow it in any of the above cases?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: OK. In the future, can you kindly post a note on your userpage, talkpage, or somewhere else so I know that the bot isn't broken?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Yes, or you could change what it looks like. What do you want to do?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I've made a start to putting the list in chart form at <url>.  Can you think of any other columns to add?\nAnnotation from annotator: 16.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Oosterman is hardly the world's foremost expert on Hyper-Calvinism.  Can you cite any scholars or experts who support your thesis?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Okay, I read through it (skimmed through some parts as they are largely repetitive). I think maybe a good place to bring this up would be in <url>?\nAnnotation from annotator: 17.0\n\nHow annotator C has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: Thanks for your note, Tom. As a matter of interest, how could you know who someone is based on the IP address?\nAnnotation from annotator: 15.0\n\nExample 2:\nText: I restored 3 non-piped blue links.  How does that look?\nAnnotation from annotator: 20.0\n\nExample 3:\nText: My bot finally got past the connection errors I've been getting and spit out the largest 4,000 articles in sorted order for this. Would you like to take a short break while I replace the first page with them and manually mark all of the already-checked ones as done?\nAnnotation from annotator: 18.0\n\nExample 4:\nText: Hi I noticed you speedied and article but not it's talk page? What's the use of leaving the talk page, discussion or no, if you're going to speedy the article?\nAnnotation from annotator: 4.0\n\nHow might annotator C label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: I've come to state that I find it mildly amusing that you don't consider a press release for a journalism award from Columbia University to be a \"substantial story from a citable source\".  Isn't Columbia among the world's most prestigious journalism schools?\nAnnotation from annotator:"
