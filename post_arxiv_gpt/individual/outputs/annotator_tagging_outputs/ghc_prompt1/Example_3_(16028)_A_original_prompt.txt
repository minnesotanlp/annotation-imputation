I refuse to be drawn into a war of words. I speak truth.\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 2:\nText: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUzZd2H7QXQ  The Root 'The 8 Kinds of Black Donald Trump Supporters'\u00a0#TheRootArticles\nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nExample 3:\nText: Its one party system. The right is bragging about unemployment numbers when we know Ovomit bastardized the formula to figure unemployment numbers more than once.

Output the annotation that seems most likely.\nText: Good Instapundit comment:\u00a0The media needs a huge dose of humility. They assume they are smarter than us, know more than us, and know what's best for us. None of which is true. Generally they are mediocre intellects good at repeating the lines they are fed, but largely out of touch with the real lives of any Americans of any race, gender or ethnicity.\u00a0 - dadvocate\nAnnotation from annotator:"
