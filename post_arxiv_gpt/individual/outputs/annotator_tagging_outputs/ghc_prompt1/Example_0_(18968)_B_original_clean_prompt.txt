How annotator A has labeled some examples:
Example 1:
Text: Freedom of the press was literally in The Constitution so that JOURNALISTS CAN REPORT/KEEP AN EYE ON GOVERNMENT without fear of reprisal.  We should always scrutinize our elected leaders, and the press does the exact opposite.  They attempt selling political ideas, and they only scrutinize those whom which they disagree.  #FailedPress
