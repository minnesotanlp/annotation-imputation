Text: Why does the J-Left media fail to show the mutilated faces of people suffering at the hands of the 3rd world invaders?  It's almost as if they know that doing so would cause people to conjure up these horrific images in their minds every time they heard of another girl murdered at the hands of invaders..  Almost as if the want to keep people ignorant of the threat.
