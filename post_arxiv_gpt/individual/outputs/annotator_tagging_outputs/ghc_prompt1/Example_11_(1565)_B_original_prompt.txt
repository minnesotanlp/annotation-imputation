Some say that Jesus fainted on the cross and regained consciousness in the tomb and then escaped. However, he was dead to the satisfaction of those who had wanted him dead - they never questioned his death. The centurion carrying out the crucifixion knew he was dead, presumably because he wasn't moving. Breathing is tortuous for those who are crucified and they are in constant motion as they struggle to breathe. If Jesus had just fainted on the cross he would have died of asphyxiation within minutes. He ceased moving at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon and was taken down from the cross just before sunset in springtime. A soldier pierced his side with a spear and blood and water came out. \nAnnotation from annotator: 0\n\nHow annotator B has labeled some examples:\nExample 1:\nText: 'The Meme The Gaming Community Created To Label SJW\u2019s Is Pretty Brilliant' \nAnnotation from annotator: 1\n\nExample 2:\nText: WELL it aint very lady like and in this climate I would not be surprised at all .
