Text: Good Instapundit comment: The media needs a huge dose of humility. They assume they are smarter than us, know more than us, and know what's best for us. None of which is true. Generally they are mediocre intellects good at repeating the lines they are fed, but largely out of touch with the real lives of any Americans of any race, gender or ethnicity.  - dadvocate
