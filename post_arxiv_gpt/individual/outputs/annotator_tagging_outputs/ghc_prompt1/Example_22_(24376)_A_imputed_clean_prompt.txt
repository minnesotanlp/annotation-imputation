How might annotator A label this example? Output the annotation that seems most likely.
Text: YOU WERE WARNED THAT THEY WOULD COME FOR YOU NEXT.  The Alt-Right warned you. We told you exactly what would happen.  YOU DIDN’T LISTEN. You didn’t want to be called “racist.” Now it will be even harder for you to fight back, because you’ve already made it clear that your issue is not *all* censorship of lawful speech, but merely the *degree* of censorship.
