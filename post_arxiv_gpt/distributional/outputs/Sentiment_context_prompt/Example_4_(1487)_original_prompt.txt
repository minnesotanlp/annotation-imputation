The possible ratings are as follows: Very negative (-2), somewhat negative (-1), neutral (0), somewhat positive (1), very positive (2).\n\nYour goal is to predict the soft label given by the raters on a particular text.\n\nHere are a few examples of texts and their soft label:\nExample 2163\nText: @TabyCat74 My Tabi is a bit older than me too. Don't feel bad. I mess with her a little too.\nSoft labels:\n0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0\n20.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1\n40.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2\n40.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3\n0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4\n\nExample 9374\nText: Not old enough yet\nSoft labels:\n0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0\n0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1\n50.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2\n50.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3\n0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4\n\nExample 4375\nText: @mileycyrus Ur special comes on E! at 12:30 am nd my 6 yr old niece attempted to stay up to watch but she couldn't hang  lol ..
