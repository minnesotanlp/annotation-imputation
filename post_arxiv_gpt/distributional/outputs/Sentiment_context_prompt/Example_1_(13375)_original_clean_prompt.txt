Here is a description of a dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked to rate the sentiment of text. The possible ratings are as follows: Very negative (-2), somewhat negative (-1), neutral (0), somewhat positive (1), very positive (2).

Your goal is to predict the soft label given by the raters on a particular text.

Here are a few examples of texts and their soft label:
Example 2162
Text: @T_Laine ah - acne.  i'm too old for it! a friend gave me some differin, but i haven't seen results over the course of a month, so....
Soft labels:
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0
25.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1
50.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2
25.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4

Example 9373
Text: Not normally into the blond hair/blue eyes, but old regular Elizabeth is back & looks amazing as ever. Alas, she's going back on tour.
Soft labels:
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0
20.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2
40.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3
40.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4

Example 4374
Text: @mileycyrus TCA won't let me vote  and i'm 15 years old.. Gawddd
Soft labels:
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0
25.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1
75.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4

Example 8876
Text: Man it's a weather advisory day. Elderly and young child stay inside today.. Under a fan or AC, my lungs r killing me.  I hate asthma!
Soft labels:
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0
50.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1
25.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2
25.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4

Now, you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate):
Target Text: realizing that i am toooo old for the stuff i pulled..my muscles hurt like hell
Soft labels:
