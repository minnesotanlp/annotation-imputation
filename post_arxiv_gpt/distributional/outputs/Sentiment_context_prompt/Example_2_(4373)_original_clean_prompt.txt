Here is a description of a dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked to rate the sentiment of text. The possible ratings are as follows: Very negative (-2), somewhat negative (-1), neutral (0), somewhat positive (1), very positive (2).

Your goal is to predict the soft label given by the raters on a particular text.

Here are a few examples of texts and their soft label:
Example 2162
Text: @T_Laine ah - acne.  i'm too old for it! a friend gave me some differin, but i haven't seen results over the course of a month, so....
Soft labels:
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0
25.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1
50.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2
25.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4

Example 9374
Text: Not old enough yet
Soft labels:
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1
50.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2
50.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4

Example 4375
Text: @mileycyrus Ur special comes on E! at 12:30 am nd my 6 yr old niece attempted to stay up to watch but she couldn't hang  lol .. She <3 u
Soft labels:
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0
25.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1
50.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2
25.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4

Example 8877
Text: Man looking at my cousins only remind me how old I've gotten lol
Soft labels:
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 0
60.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 1
20.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 2
20.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 3
0.00% of responsive annotators labeled the text with 4

Now, you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate):
Target Text: @mileycyrus TCA won't let me vote  and i'm 15 years old.. Gawddd
Soft labels:
