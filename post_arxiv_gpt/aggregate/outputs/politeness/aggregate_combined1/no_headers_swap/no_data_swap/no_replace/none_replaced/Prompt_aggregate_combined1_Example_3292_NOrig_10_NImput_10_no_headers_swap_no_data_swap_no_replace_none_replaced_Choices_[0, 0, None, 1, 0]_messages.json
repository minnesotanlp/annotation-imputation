Have you had a look at Barry Burnham's book from Oxbow of 2004?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: Yes, that's fine, especially with the smaller sections. Where will they be posting their topic ideas?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Need help with EF 175 via email. Mind <url> so we can discuss?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: The template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like 'This article is a copy of the (X) article in the German wikipedia, version 21 December 2009 10:04.' What is that template?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I'm pretty sure there already is a filter (possibly more than one) for this. What page got moved?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: As another aside, they are mostly Germans.  What's up with that?\nAnnotation: 3\n\nExample 7:\nText: i took the photo, and if the kludgy licensing template would allow me to license i would. do you actually fix things or tag spam?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: <url> is kindxe1 related to the subjects we have been dealing with. Would you mind if I ask you for advice?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: Are the remaining IPs on <url> still a problem? If so is Tom dealing with it?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Okay. Meanwhile, can you think of a good line for a <url> submission?\nAnnotation: 16\nExample 1:\nText: It would be better to have this discussion on the TKD talk page. Why don't you re-post it there?\nAnnotation: 14\n\nExample 2:\nText: No, I didn't know that. Where does this \"rule\" come from?\nAnnotation: 9\n\nExample 3:\nText: Indef-blocked. Any idea whose sock this is?\nAnnotation: 14\n\nExample 4:\nText: I have reverted your relocation of the images of this fragment - as I think it better if the images and transcripts can be seen side-by-side.  Do you agree?\nAnnotation: 17\n\nExample 5:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation: 7\n\nExample 6:\nText: I just reverted your addition of a fossil range template to <url>, because with only an arrow at the very right it didn't seem to add much useful information. Perhaps we could make a separate template to show only the Cenozoic or so, which would allow us to show more detail in these fossil ranges?\nAnnotation: 13\n\nExample 7:\nText: Done. Comments?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm sorry, but I'm unlikely to have time to help. Maybe try <url>?\nAnnotation: 15\n\nExample 9:\nText: Hello, sorry I probably should have asked first, but I thought it might be a good idea to nominate one of the images you uploaded, <url>, for featured picture. I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty, as it were?\nAnnotation: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: I deleted the redirects <url> and <url> that were a result of the page moves.  Is that all you needed?\nAnnotation: 10\nNow you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:\nText: Any more of this hoax crap at <url>, <url>, Eyre/Heller garbage, and you will be '''''permanently''''' banned from editing.  Is that clear?\nAnnotation:\n"
