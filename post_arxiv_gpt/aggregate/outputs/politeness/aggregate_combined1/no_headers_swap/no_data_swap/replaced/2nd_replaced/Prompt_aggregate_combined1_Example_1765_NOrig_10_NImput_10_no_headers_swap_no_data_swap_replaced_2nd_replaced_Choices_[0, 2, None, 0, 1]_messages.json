Have you had a look at Barry Burnham's book from Oxbow of 2004?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: I noticed you put \"NB\" and then the credit for the original picture that I cropped. What does \"NB\" stand for?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: Need help with EF 175 via email. Mind <url> so we can discuss?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: The template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like 'This article is a copy of the (X) article in the German wikipedia, version 21 December 2009 10:04.' What is that template?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I'm pretty sure there already is a filter (possibly more than one) for this. What page got moved?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: Third, what picture then should go into the Harrison Ford infobox?  Would this one (Image:Harrison Ford 1) do it?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: Thankyou for the message. Isn't it academic convention to specify which edition one has cited and give the page numbers therefrom?\nAnnotation: 15\n\nExample 8:\nText: <url> is kindxe1 related to the subjects we have been dealing with. Would you mind if I ask you for advice?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 9:\nText: Are the remaining IPs on <url> still a problem? If so is Tom dealing with it?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 10:\nText: Okay. Meanwhile, can you think of a good line for a <url> submission?\nAnnotation: 16\nImputed Majority-voted Examples:\nExample 1:\nText: It would be better to have this discussion on the TKD talk page. Why don't you re-post it there?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: No, I didn't know that. Where does this \"rule\" come from?\nAnnotation: 3\n\nExample 3:\nText: The article <url> (written with two s) was rightly deleted as it contained almost no content (Timothy (Tim) Ferriss is the author of The 4-Hour Workweek). I think you mean the science-fiction writer <url> (written wit one s) ?\nAnnotation: 10\n\nExample 4:\nText: I have reverted your relocation of the images of this fragment - as I think it better if the images and transcripts can be seen side-by-side.  Do you agree?\nAnnotation: 20\n\nExample 5:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation: 0\n\nExample 6:\nText: Your comments have been extremely helpful. I'd like to put this FAC to bed soon; is there any chance that you might be able to finish off your review of the article this weekend?\nAnnotation: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Done. Comments?\nAnnotation: 8\n\nExample 8:\nText: I'm sorry, but I'm unlikely to have time to help. Maybe try <url>?\nAnnotation: 16\n\nExample 9:\nText: Hello, sorry I probably should have asked first, but I thought it might be a good idea to nominate one of the images you uploaded, <url>, for featured picture. I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty, as it were?\nAnnotation: 16\n\nExample 10:\nText: I deleted the redirects <url> and <url> that were a result of the page moves.  Is that all you needed?\nAnnotation: 8\nPredict the integer label of the following example:\nText: <url> It would be better if the content was not quite so pejorative. Perhaps a rewording?\nAnnotation:\nYour output should be a single integer and nothing else.\n"
