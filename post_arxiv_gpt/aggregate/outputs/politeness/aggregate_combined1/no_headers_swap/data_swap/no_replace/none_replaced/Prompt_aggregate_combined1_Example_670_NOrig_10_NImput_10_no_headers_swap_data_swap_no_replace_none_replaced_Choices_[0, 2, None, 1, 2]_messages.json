What does that mean?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more?\nAnnotation: 8\n\nExample 3:\nText: The article <url> (written with two s) was rightly deleted as it contained almost no content (Timothy (Tim) Ferriss is the author of The 4-Hour Workweek). I think you mean the science-fiction writer <url> (written wit one s) ?\nAnnotation: 13\n\nExample 4:\nText: When someone tags articles using non-existent criteria, there's no way the articles should be deleted. The deleting admin has restored Reviewmageddon now, so it seems it's sorted out?\nAnnotation: 13\n\nExample 5:\nText: <url> and <url> seem to be two articles on the same subject.  What's the point of having separate articles?\nAnnotation: 7\n\nExample 6:\nText: Your comments have been extremely helpful. I'd like to put this FAC to bed soon; is there any chance that you might be able to finish off your review of the article this weekend?\nAnnotation: 16\n\nExample 7:\nText: Pat, for someone who has died, you don't say \"he is a former professional baseball player\", you say \"he was a professional baseball player\".

Is our Chinese friend still persisting?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 2:\nText: I noticed you put \"NB\" and then the credit for the original picture that I cropped. What does \"NB\" stand for?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 3:\nText: <url> has been blanked. Is it possible to retrieve this information?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 4:\nText: The template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like 'This article is a copy of the (X) article in the German wikipedia, version 21 December 2009 10:04.' What is that template?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 5:\nText: I'm pretty sure there already is a filter (possibly more than one) for this. What page got moved?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 6:\nText: Third, what picture then should go into the Harrison Ford infobox?  Would this one (Image:Harrison Ford 1) do it?\nAnnotation: 12\n\nExample 7:\nText: Thankyou for the message.

Can you find multiple non-trivial mentions in reliable sources that refer to it?\nAnnotation: 12\nNow you will make your prediction (if you are unsure, just give your best estimate.) Your output should be an integer label:\nText: :I have blocked them for 24 hours, noting that continued soapboxing will attract further sanctions and a suggestion they take any complaint regarding my actions to ANI. Let us see what the future brings, then?\nAnnotation:\nIf you output anything other than a single integer (and absolutely nothing else, including explanatory text), your output will invalidate the dataset. So, please only output a single integer.\n"
