Here's a description of a dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked whether they believe a tweet contains hatespeech or not. 0 means no hatespeech, and 1 means that there is hatespeech.

Given the previous dataset description, your goal is to predict how one of the annotators of the previous dataset would annotate an example from that dataset. You will be given 4 samples of how that particular annotator has responded to other examples and be shown what the plurality of annotators gave as a label, and will then complete the prediction for the target example as that annotator would.
