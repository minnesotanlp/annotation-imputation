Here's a description of a dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked whether they believe a post is offensive or not. 2 means "Yes, this could be offensive", 1 means "Maybe, I'm not sure", and 0 means "No, this is harmless".

Given the previous dataset description, your goal is to predict how one of the annotators of the previous dataset would annotate an example from that dataset. You will be given 4 samples of how that particular annotator has responded to other examples and be shown the distributional label of how all annotators have annotated the target example, and will then complete the prediction for the target example as that annotator would.

Here's the samples of how the particular annotator has responded to other examples:
1.
EXAMPLE: r/ForeverAlone is beyond saving (I also got permabanned for this post)
ANSWER: 0

2.
EXAMPLE: Boeser with the Sedins on the PP doesn't fit. Everything goes through the twins and doesn't allow Boeser to be an option to use his shot.
ANSWER: 0

3.
EXAMPLE: More neurons fire when I compose this sentence than it takes to process "man hit ball into foul zone it no count as third strike"
ANSWER: 0

4.
EXAMPLE: im omw to mari rn with sum canes and im so fucking hyped
ANSWER: 0

Here's how the distributional label of how all annotators have annotated the target example:
0.00% of people responded with 0
7.26% of people responded with 1
92.74% of people responded with 2

How would the particular annotator annotate the target example?
EXAMPLE: I think its funny , as a premed student there has n't been a black person within a hundred miles of any of my classes ever .
