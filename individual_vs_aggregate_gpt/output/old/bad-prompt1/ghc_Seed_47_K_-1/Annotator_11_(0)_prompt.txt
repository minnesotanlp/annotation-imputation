Here's a description of a dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked whether they believe a tweet contains hatespeech or not. 0 means no hatespeech, and 1 means that there is hatespeech.

You will be given 4 samples of how that particular annotator has responded to other examples and be shown what the plurality of annotators gave as a label, and will then complete the prediction for the target example as that annotator would.
