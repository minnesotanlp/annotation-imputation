Here's a description of a dataset:
In this dataset, people are asked whether they believe a post is offensive or not. 2 means "Yes, this could be offensive", 1 means "Maybe, I'm not sure", and 0 means "No, this is harmless".

Given the previous dataset description, your goal is to predict how one of the annotators of the previous dataset would annotate an example from that dataset. You will be given 4 samples of how that particular annotator has responded to other examples and be shown the distributional label of how all annotators have annotated the target example, and will then complete the prediction for the target example as that annotator would.

Here's the samples of how the particular annotator has responded to other examples:
1.
EXAMPLE: roses are red . roses are red violets are blue , harambe was shot dead in the cincinnati zoo
ANSWER: 0

2.
EXAMPLE: did you know that <number>  of children with the initial a.d.d. <allcaps> actually have add <allcaps> [ removed ]
ANSWER: 0

EXAMPLE: i 'm not racist i just have preferences [ removed ]
ANSWER: 0

4.
EXAMPLE: you know what they say about <number> / <number> jokes . <repeat> they 're just plane wrong
ANSWER: 0

Here's how the distributional label of how all annotators have annotated the target example:
33.33% of people responded with 0
0.00% of people responded with 1
66.67% of people responded with 2

How would the particular annotator annotate the target example?
EXAMPLE: hey girl , are you an igneous rock ? cuz you used to be hot
ANSWER:
