Here's a description of a dataset:
{dataset_description}

Given the previous dataset description, your goal is to predict how one of the annotators of the previous dataset would annotate an example from that dataset. You will be given {n_shots} samples of how that particular annotator has responded to other examples and {k_shots} sample of how others have annotated the target example, and will then complete the prediction for the target example as that annotator would.

Here's the samples of how the particular annotator has responded to other examples:
{shots}

Here's the samples of how others have annotated the target example:
{other_shots}

How would the particular annotator annotate the target example?
{target_example_line}
